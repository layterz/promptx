# Apps

You can use **promptz** as a library or a framework, which defines a consistent project structure and generates an API, admin interface and cli for you to interact with your prompts and collections.

Let's create a new app:

```bash
pz create my-app
cd my-app
```

This will create a new directory called `my-app` with the following structure:

```
my-app
├── admin
├── notebooks
├── prompts
├── systems
├── app.py
├── README.md
```
