# Custom prompts

Most of the time you'll be able to use the standard prompt either by creating an instance of `Prompt` or using the `prompt` helper. However, if the default prompt doesn't fit your use case, you can create your own custom prompt by subclassing `Prompt` and overriding the template and lifecycle methods.
