    "\n",
    "[Dramatron](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14958.pdf) is a paper published by Deepmind in 2022 describing an approach for procedurally generating stories. It starts with a logline provided by the user (e.g. \"A farm boy from a desert planet joins a rebellion against an evil empire\") and uses that to first generate a title and characters, which are then used to generate subsequent content like locations and scene beats. Figure 1. from the paper outlines this approach in full. \n"

The room is filled with old furniture covered in sheets and broken glass scattered on the floor. Neo's heart pounds in his chest as he waits anxiously for Morpheus, the leader of the rebel group.\\n\\nTRINITY, a mysterious rebel and Neo's newfound ally, stands by his side, her eyes filled with determination. She places a hand on Neo's shoulder, offering him support.\\n\\nTRINITY\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mwhispering\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nYou're doing great, Neo. Morpheus will show you the truth. Just be ready to accept it.\\n\\nNeo nods, his eyes darting around the room, his mind overwhelmed with anticipation. Suddenly, the sound of footsteps echoes through the hallway outside the room, growing closer with each passing moment.\\n\\nThe door to the room swings open, revealing MORPHEUS, a tall and imposing figure, dressed in a long black coat. His eyes scan the room before locking onto Neo.\\n\\nMORPHEUS\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mwith a calm yet commanding tone\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nNeo, I'm glad you decided to join us.

The red pill will show you the truth, the harsh reality. The blue pill will let you return to the blissful ignorance you've known.

His hand quivers as he reaches for the red pill, his resolve firm.\\n\\nNEO\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mwhispering\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nI choose the red pill.\\n\\nNeo takes the red pill from Morpheus' hand and swallows it, a sense of relief washing over him.
