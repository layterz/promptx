    "\n",
    "[Dramatron](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14958.pdf) is a paper published by Deepmind in 2022 describing an approach for procedurally generating stories. It starts with a logline provided by the user (e.g. \"A farm boy from a desert planet joins a rebellion against an evil empire\") and uses that to first generate a title and characters, which are then used to generate subsequent content like locations and scene beats. Figure 1. from the paper outlines this approach in full. \n"

But be warned, Neo. The path ahead is dangerous, and the controllers will stop at nothing to eliminate us.\\n\\nNeo looks down, contemplating his options. He knows deep down that his life will never be the same again, no matter what choice he makes.\\n\\nNEO\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mresolute\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nI'm ready. Show me the truth.\\n\\nTrinity nods, a mix of relief and determination on her face.\\n\\nTRINITY\\nWelcome to the real world, Neo.\\n\\nThey fade into the shadows, walking away together towards an uncertain future, their footsteps echoing in the empty streets.\\n\\nFADE OUT.\"\u001b[0m,\n",
       "    \u001b[32m\"INT. NEO'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nThe living room is dimly lit, with a flickering TV casting a faint glow over the worn-out furniture. Neo sits on the couch, staring blankly at the screen, trying to make sense of the events that just unfolded.\\n\\nNeo \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mmuttering to himself\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nIt can't be real... It's just a prank, a really elaborate prank.\\n\\nNeo shakes his head, dismissing the revelations he heard from the rebels as nothing more than a figment of his imagination. He grabs the TV remote, attempting to find solace in the mindless distractions of the digital world.\\n\\nJust then, a knock on the door interrupts Neo's attempt to escape the truth. He hesitates for a moment before reluctantly getting up to answer it.\\n\\nNeo opens the door, revealing Morpheus standing outside, his expression serious and determined.\\n\\nMorpheus\\nNeo, we need to talk.\\n\\nNeo's eyes widen, surprised to see Morpheus at his doorstep. He takes a step back, feeling a mixture of curiosity and apprehension.\\n\\nNeo\\nWhat are you doing here? How did you find me?\\n\\nMorpheus\\nWe've been watching you, Neo. We know more about you than you realize.\\n\\nNeo's skepticism resurfaces, as he struggles to comprehend the gravity of the situation.\\n\\nNeo\\nThis is insane! You're telling me that everything I know, everything I've believed in, is a lie?\\n\\nMorpheus\\nYes, Neo. The world as you know it is an illusion, a digital prison designed to keep us under control. But you have the power to break free from it.\\n\\nNeo glances behind Morpheus, noticing Trinity standing a few steps away, observing their conversation. Her presence somehow reassures him, infusing a glimmer of hope.\\n\\nNeo \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mhesitant\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nAnd if I refuse?\\n\\nMorpheus' eyes lock with Neo's, unwavering in conviction.\\n\\nMorpheus\\nThen you'll continue living a life of ignorance, trapped in a simulated reality controlled by the very entities we're fighting against. You have a choice, Neo. The red pill or the blue pill.\\n\\nNeo's hands tremble, his mind racing with doubts and uncertainties. Deep down, he knows that accepting Morpheus' offer will forever change his life.\\n\\nNeo \u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mresolute\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nI... I need some time to think.\\n\\nMorpheus nods, understanding Neo's hesitance.\\n\\nMorpheus\\nTake all the time you need, but remember, the world isn't what it seems, Neo. The truth is waiting for you, whenever you're ready.\\n\\nAs Morpheus turns to leave, Neo watches him and Trinity disappear into the darkness of the hallway. The weight of his decision weighs heavily on his shoulders as he closes the door, leaving him alone in his ordinary apartment, surrounded by the unknown.\\n\\nFADE OUT.\"\u001b[0m\n",
