    "\n",
    "[Dramatron](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14958.pdf) is a paper published by Deepmind in 2022 describing an approach for procedurally generating stories. It starts with a logline provided by the user (e.g. \"A farm boy from a desert planet joins a rebellion against an evil empire\") and uses that to first generate a title and characters, which are then used to generate subsequent content like locations and scene beats. Figure 1. from the paper outlines this approach in full. \n"
