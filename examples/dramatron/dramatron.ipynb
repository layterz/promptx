The room is cluttered with cables and hard drives, a reflection of his obsession with hacking.\\n\\nNEO, early 30s, is an average-looking guy with an intense gaze. He is completely absorbed in his work, typing furiously as lines of code appear on the screens.\\n\\nSuddenly, the door to the apartment bursts open, and MORPHEUS, a charismatic man in his 40s, storms in. He is dressed all in black, a stark contrast to Neo's casual attire.\\n\\nMORPHEUS\\nNeo! You've been searching for answers, haven't you?\\n\\nNeo looks up, bewilderment apparent on his face.\\n\\nNEO\\nWho are you?\\n\\nMorpheus walks towards Neo, his gaze never wavering.\\n\\nMORPHEUS\\nI am Morpheus. And I've come to offer you a choice. The red pill, or the blue pill.\\n\\nNeo's curiosity gets the better of him as he stares at the pills in Morpheus' outstretched hand.\\n\\nNEO\\nWhat's the difference?\\n\\nMorpheus smiles knowingly.\\n\\nMORPHEUS\\nThe red pill will show you the truth. The truth about the Matrix, about your existence, and your place in the war against the controllers. The blue pill...will let you continue living the life you have always known. The choice is yours, Neo.\\n\\nNeo hesitates, his eyes darting between the pills and Morpheus.\\n\\nNEO\\nHow do I know this is real?\\n\\nMorpheus reaches out and touches Neo's shoulder, his voice filled with conviction.\\n\\nMORPHEUS\\nYou will have to trust me. The Matrix is everywhere, all around us. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.\\n\\nAs Morpheus speaks, Neo glances at his computer screen, which displays a puzzling image - a black cat walking by, repeating the exact same movements.\\n\\nNEO\\nThe Matrix...\\n\\nMorpheus nods, a glimmer of excitement in his eyes.\\n\\nMORPHEUS\\nYes, Neo. It's all around you. But I can show you how to unplug from it.\\n\\nJust then, TRINITY, a beautiful woman in her late 20s, appears in the doorway, a look of determination on her face.\\n\\nTRINITY\\nWe don't have much time. The Agents are coming.\\n\\nAgent SMITH's shadow looms in the hallway behind Trinity, his presence felt even before he enters the room.\\n\\nAGENT SMITH\\nYou can't hide from us, Mr. Anderson.\\n\\nNeo's heart races as he realizes the danger he is in. He looks at Morpheus, then at the pills in his hand.\\n\\nNEO\\nI...I choose the red pill.\\n\\nMorpheus smiles, triumphantly.\\n\\nMORPHEUS\\nWelcome to the real world, Neo.\\n\\nNeo takes the red pill from Morpheus' hand and swallows it, his face filled with a mix of fear and anticipation.\\n\\nAs the pill takes effect, the room starts to fade away, revealing the true nature of the world.\\n\\nFADE OUT.\"\u001b[0m"

You have finally realized your true potential as the One. With your abilities, we can now fight back against the agents and free more minds from the Matrix.\\n\\nNeo takes a moment to catch his breath, a mix of exhaustion and excitement coursing through his veins. He looks at Morpheus, Trinity, and the rest of the rebels, a fire burning in his eyes.\\n\\nNEO\\n\u001b[0m\u001b[32m(\u001b[0m\u001b[32mwith determination\u001b[0m\u001b[32m)\u001b[0m\u001b[32m\\nWe will bring an end to this war.

       "    \u001b[32m\"INT. OFFICE BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT\\n\\nNeo and Trinity stand on the edge of the rooftop, looking out at the sprawling cityscape below. The wind howls around them, adding to the tension in the air.\\n\\nTRINITY\\nWe don't have much time, Neo. The defenses are getting stronger. We need to get out of here before they overwhelm us.\\n\\nNeo's face is determined, his eyes focused on the city below.\\n\\nNEO\\nI know, Trinity. We can't let them catch us. The fate of humanity depends on our escape.\\n\\nThey both glance back at the open door that leads back into the building. Neo can hear the sound of footsteps getting closer.\\n\\nTRINITY\\nMorpheus said there's a way out of here. We just have to find it.\\n\\nJust then, Agent Smith emerges from the door, a malevolent grin on his face.\\n\\nAGENT SMITH\\nYou won't be going anywhere, Mr. Anderson. I'm afraid your little game is over.\\n\\nNeo clenches his fists, ready for a fight. Trinity stands beside him, her hand on her weapon.\\n\\nNEO\\nNot if we can help it.\\n\\nThey charge at Agent Smith, dodging his lightning-fast attacks. Neo's movements become fluid and precise, a result of his training in the Matrix. Trinity fights with equal skill, her martial arts expertise shining through.\\n\\nBut Agent Smith is relentless, his attacks growing more aggressive and powerful. He seems to be everywhere at once, a formidable opponent.\\n\\nTRINITY\\nNeo, we can't keep this up! We need to find another way!\\n\\nNeo looks around, his eyes scanning the rooftop. And then he spots it - a ventilation shaft.\\n\\nNEO\\nThere! The ventilation shaft. It leads down to the lower levels. We can make our escape from there.\\n\\nThey disengage from Agent Smith and race towards the shaft, bullets whizzing past them. Trinity takes point, shooting back at their pursuer to keep him at bay.\\n\\nAs they crawl through the narrow shaft, Neo can hear Agent Smith close behind them. The sound of his footsteps echoes in their ears, urging them to go faster.\\n\\nFinally, they reach the end of the shaft and drop down into a dimly lit corridor. They catch their breath, their chests heaving with exertion.\\n\\nTRINITY\\nWe made it. But we can't rest yet. We have to keep moving.\\n\\nNeo nods, his determination unwavering.\\n\\nNEO\\nWe're closer to the truth now, Trinity. We won't stop until we've freed humanity from the Matrix's grasp.\\n\\nThey continue their journey through the building, their path uncertain but their resolve resolute.\\n\\nFADE OUT.\"\u001b[0m,\n",
