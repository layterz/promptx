INT. DIAMOND DISTRICT JEWELRY SHOP - DAY

Demany enters, followed by Howard, Julia, Kevin and Dinah. Everyone hovers around Howard, who can't take his eyes off the gambling game on the TV.

HOWARD
Yes! I knew it, didn't I say?

The room celebrates, but the clapping and cheering stops abruptly when the door swings open. An embittered enemy enters, gun in hand.

ENEMY
Congratulations on your win Howard.

The room is silent. Howard turns slowly, smiling, expecting more congratulations.

HOWARD
(laughs)
Thanks, I-- 

The words die in his throat as the enemy pulls the trigger. Howard falls onto the floor. All gasp as chaos ensues. 

FADE OUT.
