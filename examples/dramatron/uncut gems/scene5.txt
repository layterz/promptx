INT. HOWARD RATNER'S JEWEL SHOP - AFTERNOON

Howard hurriedly navigates through the shiny glass-fronted shop, fielding phone calls on his headset.

HOWARD
(into headset)
Yeah, Kevin, the gem... I need it back, yeah?

Howard clicks off, switches lines.

HOWARD
(into headset)
Yes, I promised it will be there at the auction... I'm getting it, okay?

The door jingles open. In walks DEMANY.

DEMANY
Howard, where the hell is the gemstone? Garnett's already left the city!

HOWARD
I'm handling it, Demany!

Howard ends the call, swings around to face Demany.

HOWARD
Why'd you introduce him to the stone in the first place, huh?

Suddenly, another door swings open. Howardâ€™s estranged wife DINAH steps in.

DINAH
Howard, you missed parent-teacher conference. Again.

Howard looks taken aback.

HOWARD
Dinah, I - I'm dealing with something here.

Before Howard can explain further, JULIA, his girlfriend enters the room.

JULIA
Howard, these guys outside - they're asking for you.

She extends a hand, showing a card from a debt collection agency. Howard sighs, runs a hand over his face, the stress of his life closing in on him. 

FADE OUT.
