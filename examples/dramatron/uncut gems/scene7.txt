DEMANY
Howard, what the hell is going on?
HOWARD
Calm down, Demany. There was a little hiccup with the bet, that’s all.
DEMANY
A hiccup? That was a lot of money, Howard.
HOWARD
I know, I know. I’m fixing it.
(Howard frantically dials a number on his cell phone)
GAMBLING BOOKIE
(phone)
Howard? What's it this time?
HOWARD
Look, my bet was cancelled. I need to place it again. ASAP.
GAMBLING BOOKIE
(phone)
I can't do that, Howard. Your account is closed.
HOWARD
What? Closed? You've got to be kidding me.
GAMBLING BOOKIE
(phone)
You're overdrawn, Howard. Until you can settle up, no more bets.
HOWARD
(thinking)
Just give me a minute...
DEMANY
Howard, do you have any idea what you're doing?
HOWARD
(to Demany)
Can you just trust me on this?
JULIA
(entering room)
What happened, Howard? You're pale as a ghost.
HOWARD
They've closed my account. I can't place the bet.
JULIA
What? After all this work?
(Howard nods, frantic)
JULIA
(thinking)
Wait...I have an idea.
HOWARD
Anything, Julia.
JULIA
I can place the bet. They don't know me.
HOWARD
Think it’ll work?
(DEMANY nods approvingly)
JULIA
Only one way to find out.
(Julia exits to make the call. Howard, Demany, and the onlookers wait anxiously.)
