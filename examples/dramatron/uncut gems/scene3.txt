INT. DIAMOND DISTRICT JEWELRY SHOP, NYC - DAY

The bell above the door CHIMES as DEMANY enters with KEVIN GARNETT. HOWARD, behind the counter, looks up in surprise.

HOWARD
Demany, you didn't tell me you were bringing a superstar.

DEMANY
Surprise, Howard. Kevin is interested in exceptional pieces...

Howard catches Kevin's eyes, a SPARKLING GEMSTONE in his hand.

HOWARD
Well, you're in luck. This is the most beautiful thing you'll ever see.

Howard reveals the gemstone with a DRAMATIC FLAIR. Kevin is visibly enticed by the gemstone. He reaches out for it, his eyes wide.

KEVIN GARNETT
This is a beautiful piece, how much?

Howard hesitates, glancing at Demany. He looks back at Kevin with a calculating smile.

HOWARD
We'll talk numbers later, right now it's vibes. The gem has to speak to you...

In Corner, JULIA watches Howard interact with Kevin. DINAH enters, maintaining a palpable frigidity toward Howard.

DINAH
Demany, can you take a look at these?

Demany excuses himself to go over to Dinah, leaving Howard alone with Kevin. Kevin continues to gaze at the gemstone longingly.

HOWARD
The thing is, Kevin...I believe the value of this gem will increase manifold at auction. It would take a pretty penny for me to part from it right now.

Off Kevin's reaction, Howard claps him on the shoulder, a tension under his seemingly affable demeanor. 

HOWARD
You understand, right? Itâ€™s just business after all.

FADE OUT.
