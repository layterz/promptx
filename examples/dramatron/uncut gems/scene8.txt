And Garnett with the shot... and he makes it! Boston takes the win!

Crowd ROARS, Demany JUMPS up, cheering. 

DEMANAY
That’s what I’m talking about! 

Howard, winning his bet, is ecstatic. He SCREAMS passionately at the result. He turns to Julia.

HOWARD
Did you see that?

JULIA
I did, Howard! That was amazing!

They hug each other tightly. The winning mood is contagious; everyone is happy and celebrating.

CUT TO Dinah, watching the game on a TV in the bar, she gives a weak SMILE. She’s happy for Howard but worries about the consequences later. 

Closing on Howard, the camera captures his satisfaction. He’s back in the game.
