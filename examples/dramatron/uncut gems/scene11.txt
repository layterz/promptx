INT. DIAMOND DISTRICT JEWELRY SHOP - DAY

The bustling shop goes silent as a GUNSHOT echoes out, shocking the patrons present. Howard crumples to the floor behind the counter where he has been watching the game. A shocked silence fills the room.

Suddenly, the TV ANNOUNCER's voice breaks through the silence, revealing the result of the game.

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The game is over! The Celtics win it!

Howard's lifeless eyes stare at the screen displaying the win, a triumphant yet tragic smile on his face. Julia, Dinah, Demany, and Kevin stare in horror at their fallen friend, mixed emotions of shock, despair, and confusion swirling within them. 

FADE OUT.
