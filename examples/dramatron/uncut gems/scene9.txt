DINAH
Howard, we need to talk about us.

HOWARD
Us? There's always an 'us,' Dinah. Something else came up. A big hit. 

DINAH
A hit? Is that all you think about, Howard? Bets and deals?

HOWARD
What do you want me to say, Dinah? I’m trying to keep us afloat!

DINAH
At what cost, Howard?

HOWARD
Every cost if I have to!

(Enter JULIA)

JULIA
Howard, we got that winning. It’s big.

HOWARD
See, Dinah? I told you! 

(Enter DEMANY)

DEMANY
Howard, man, you need to pay your debts. You can’t keep pushing it.

HOWARD
I know Demany, I know. I will get everything sorted out.

JULIA
He will Demany, we have the money now.

DEMANY
Good, 'bout time. And keep Garnett out of your dirty plays.

HOWARD
Alright, alright. Dinah, trust me, everything will be alright. 

DINAH
I hope so, Howard… I really do.
