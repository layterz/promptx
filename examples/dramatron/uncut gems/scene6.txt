INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

Howard looks distraught as he handles the precious gemstone. Demany walks in with Kevin Garnett.

DEMANI
Look who's here.

Howard lifts his head, his gaze moving from the gemstone to the tall, imposing figure of Kevin Garnett. A smirk forms on his face. 

HOWARD
Kevin! I've got something special for you.

Kevin approaches the counter where the gemstone lies. His eyes sparkle with anticipation.

KEVIN
Is that it?

HOWARD
Yes.

Howard picks up the gemstone and hands it to Kevin who seems fascinated by its allure. Howard can't help but grin. He seems to have found his potential lifesaver. 

HOWARD
How about an exciting deal on this, Kevin?

A moment of silence as Kevin inspects the gemstone.

CUT TO:

INT. HOWARD'S SHOP - NIGHT

Julia watches as Howard paces around, a phone pressed to his ear.

HOWARD
(into phone)
Yes, I want to pawn this gemstone.

In the background, Julia gasps. She didn't expect Howard to resort to such extremes.

CUT TO:

EXT. BACK-ALLEY - NIGHT

Howard hangs up the phone, his breaths coming out in ragged puffs. He stares at the gemstone one last time before putting it away. Now, all he can do is wait and hope.

HOWARD
(to himself)
Let's win big, Kevin.
