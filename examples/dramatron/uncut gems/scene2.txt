Howard and Demany are in the shop as it buzzes with customers. Howard opens a package revealing a rare gemstone. He is overjoyed and hopeful about the possibilities.

HOWARD
(eyes sparkling with delight)
Demany, do you see this? It's the chance we've been waiting for!

DEMANY
(skeptical)
What makes you think that rock is gonna solve your money troubles, Howard?

HOWARD
(profound confidence)
Trust me, this isn't just any rock, it's our ticket out of here. I can feel it.

At that moment, Kevin Garnett walks into the shop. He's introduced to Howard by Demany.

DEMANY
(to Kevin)
Kevin, this is Howard. He runs the place.

KEVIN
(nods, inspecting a case of jewelry)
Nice to meet you, Howard.

HOWARD
(grinning)
Nice meeting you, Kevin.

Howard shows Kevin the gemstone, who is immediately fascinated.

Meanwhile, Julia watches the interaction, a supportive gleam in her eyes. Dinah, on the other hand, after clocking Howard's excitement towards the gemstone displays worry and disapproval.
