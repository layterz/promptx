INT. BASKETBALL GAME - NIGHT

Crowd ROARS as the game twists and turns. Howard anxiously watches from the sidelines. Kevin Garnett on the court, a force of nature.

Dinah, his estranged wife, sits next to him, brow furrowed. Demany, his business partner and Julia, his supportive girlfriend are also by the courtside.

HOWARD
(to Garnett)
You feel the energy of this gem, right Kevin? 

GARNETT
I feel it. It's special, Howard. 

HOWARD
I know. You have a big game tomorrow, and I want you to take this gem with you.

GARNETT
What? Really?

Demany looks at Howard, surprised and worried.

DEMANy
Howard! What are you doing?

Dinah shoots Howard a glare, aware of the risks.

DINAH
Howard, we discussed this. The gem stays in the safe until the auction. 

Howard gives Dinah a soothing look, then turns to Garnett.

HOWARD
Never mind them, Kevin. How about this, you borrow it for the big game, then return it.

Garnett looks surprised, but nods and agrees.

GARNETT
Alright, Howard. I trust you.

Howard, against all odds and warnings, gives the precious gem to Garnett. He watches Garnett leave the court with the gem in his possession, crossing into an exciting but dangerous gamble. 

JULIA
(whispering to Howard)
Are you sure about this, Howard?

HOWARD
Trust me, Julia, this is a game changer.
