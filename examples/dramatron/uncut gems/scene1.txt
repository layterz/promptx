INT. DIAMOND DISTRICT JEWELRY SHOP - DAY

HOWARD RATNER, mid-40s, nervous energy personified, is behind the counter dealing with several CUSTOMERS. KEVIN GARNETT, DEMANY, JULIA, and DINAH are amongst the hustle and bustle. Chime bells ring signaling the door opening frequently. 

HOWARD
(Double dealing with two customers)
Of course, sir, these diamonds are of highest quality, as rare as they come. And madam, I assure you this necklace will catch every eye in the room.

Just then, Howard's cell phone rings. He pulls it out, checking the caller ID. It's a bookie. 

HOWARD
(To the customers)
Just a minute.

Cuts the call, puts it back in pocket.

HOWARD
(Back to customers)
Sorry about that. 

He turns to JULIA who's nearby.

HOWARD
(whispering)
Julia, check out the opals for Mr. Garnett.

Julia nods and heads in the direction of Garnett.

HOWARD
(to DINAH)
And Dinah, can you handle the cash register?

Dinah nods, less than thrilled with the task.

Dinah heads over to the cash register. Howard goes back to dealing with customers, oblivious to the tense atmosphere around him.
