{"question": "Samantha sleeps an average of 8 hours a night. Her baby sister sleeps 2.5 times as much as Samantha does. Because her father is so tired from watching the baby, for every hour the baby sleeps, he sleeps 30 minutes. How many hours does her father sleep in a week?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the number of hours Samantha sleeps in a night, \\( B \\) represent the number of hours the baby sleeps in a night, and \\( F \\) represent the number of hours the father sleeps in a night. The total number of hours the father sleeps in a week is given by:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{week}} = 7 \\times F \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = 8 \\) hours (hours Samantha sleeps in a night)\n\nSince the baby sleeps 2.5 times as much as Samantha does, we can express \\( B \\) as \\( 2.5S \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ B = 2.5S \\]\n\nSince the father sleeps for every hour the baby sleeps, we can express \\( F \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2}B \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2}B \\]\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n\\[ B = 2.5 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ B = 20 \\]\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 \\]\n\\[ F = 10 \\]\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{week}} = 7 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ F_{\\text{week}} = 70 \\]\n\nTherefore, the father sleeps for a total of 70 hours in a week.\n####\n70"}
