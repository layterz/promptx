{"question": "Alex is saving up for a new car. He already has $14,500 saved up and the car costs $14,600. He decides that to make the last of the money he will deliver groceries for people in the neighborhood.  He charges $1.5 per trip and then 5% of the price of the groceries. If he makes 40 trips and has saved up enough, how many dollars' worth of groceries did he deliver?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the amount of money saved up by Alex, \\( C \\) represent the cost of the car, \\( N_T \\) represent the number of trips made by Alex, \\( P_t \\) represent the price charged per trip, \\( P_g \\) represent the percentage of the price of groceries charged, and \\( G \\) represent the total value of groceries delivered.\n\nThe equation to find the value of groceries delivered is given by:\n\n\\[ G = \\frac{N_T}{P_g} \\]\n\nSince Alex charges $1.5 per trip and 5% of the price of groceries, we can express \\( P_g \\) as \\( 0.05 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ G = \\frac{N_T}{0.05} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total value of groceries delivered (\\( G \\)) is equal to the number of trips (\\( N_T \\)) divided by 0.05.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( N_T = 40 \\) trips (number of trips made by Alex)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ G = \\frac{40}{0.05} \\]\n\\[ G = \\frac{40}{0.05} \\times \\frac{100}{100} \\]\n\\[ G = 40 \\times 20 \\]\n\\[ G = 800 \\]\n\nTherefore, Alex delivered $800 worth of groceries.\n####\n800"}

{"question": "Zach is saving his money to buy a brand new bike that costs $100.  His weekly allowance is $5.  His parent will pay him an extra $10 to mow the lawn.  His neighbor will pay him $7 per hour to babysit their son.  He has already saved up $65.  He'll receive his allowance on Friday and he's planning on babysitting for 2 hours this Saturday after he mows the lawn.  How much more money does Zach need to earn before he can buy the bike?", "answer": "Let's analyze Zach's situation. \n\n- Zach will earn $14 from babysitting for 2 hours at $7 per hour. \n- He will also receive $5 allowance and $10 for mowing the lawn, totaling $29 for the week.\n- Adding his $65 savings to the amount he will earn, Zach will have a total of $29 + $65 = $94.\n- The bike costs $100, so Zach will need to earn an additional $100 - $94 = $6.\n\nTherefore, Zach will need to earn $6 more before he can buy the bike. \n#### 6"}
