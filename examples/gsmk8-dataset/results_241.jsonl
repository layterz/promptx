{"question": "Tom receives a $12 allowance per month. In the first week, he spends a third of it; in the second week, he spends a quarter of what he has left. How much money does he have left to finish the month?", "answer": "Let \\( A \\) represent the allowance Tom receives per month. The equation to calculate the amount of money he has left at the end of the month is given by:\n\n\\[ A - \\left( \\frac{A}{3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{A}{4} \\right) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount of money Tom has left (\\( A \\)) is his initial allowance subtracted by the amount he spends in the first week (\\( \\frac{A}{3} \\)) and the amount he spends in the second week (\\( \\frac{A}{4} \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A = 12 \\) dollars (allowance per month)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ A - \\left( \\frac{A}{3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{A}{4} \\right) \\]\n\\[ 12 - \\left( \\frac{12}{3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{12}{4} \\right) \\]\n\\[ 12 - 4 - 3 \\]\n\\[ 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tom has $6 left to finish the month.####\n6"}
{"question": "Granger has five times as many spots as his brother, Cisco.  But Cisco has 5 less than half as many spots as his cousin, Rover.  If Rover has 46 spots, how many spots do Granger and Cisco have combined?", "answer": "Let \\( G \\) represent the number of spots Granger has, \\( C \\) represent the number of spots Cisco has, and \\( R \\) represent the number of spots Rover has. \n\nWe are given that Rover has 46 spots, so \\( R = 46 \\).\n\nIf Cisco has 5 less than half as many spots as Rover has, then Cisco has \\( 46/2 - 5 = 23 - 5 = 18 \\) spots. \nSo \\( C = 18 \\).\n\nIf Granger has five times as many spots as Cisco, then Granger has \\( 18 \\times 5 = 90 \\) spots.\nSo \\( G = 90 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total combined number of spots that Granger and Cisco have is \\( G + C = 90 + 18 = 108 \\) spots.\n####\n108"}
