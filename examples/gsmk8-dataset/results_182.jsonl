{"question": "Several birds were sitting in the branches of a crape myrtle tree.  There were three times more cardinals than bluebirds, but half as many swallows as bluebirds. If there were 2 swallows, what is the total number of birds in the crape myrtle tree?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the number of bluebirds, \\( C \\) represent the number of cardinals, and \\( S \\) represent the number of swallows in the crape myrtle tree. The total number of birds \\( T \\) in the tree is given by:\n\n\\[ T = B + C + S \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = 2 \\) swallows\n\nSince there are half as many swallows as bluebirds, we can express \\( S \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2}B \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = B + C + \\frac{1}{2}B \\]\n\nSince there are three times more cardinals than bluebirds, we can express \\( C \\) as \\( 3B \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = B + 3B + \\frac{1}{2}B \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{5}{2}B \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of birds in the crape myrtle tree (\\( T \\)) is two and a half times the number of bluebirds (\\( B \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = 2 \\) swallows\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{5}{2} \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\\[ T = 2 \\times \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\\[ T = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds in the crape myrtle tree is 18.\n#### 18"}
{"question": "James visits 20 houses to try and make a sale.  He manages to sell something in every house.  The next day he visits twice as many houses but only sold to 80% of houses.  If he sold two things at each house in each of the two days, how many items did he sell?", "answer": "Let \\( H_1 \\) represent the number of houses visited on the first day, \\( H_2 \\) represent the number of houses visited on the second day, and \\( S \\) represent the number of items sold.\n\nOn the first day, James visited 20 houses and sold something in each house. Therefore, the number of houses visited on the second day is twice the number of houses visited on the first day (\\( H_2 = 2 \\times H_1 \\)).\n\nOn the second day, James only sold to 80% of the houses he visited. So the number of houses he sold to on the second day is 80% of the total number of houses visited on the second day (\\( S_H = 0.8 \\times H_2 \\)).\n\nThe total number of houses James sold something at is the sum of the number of houses visited on the first and second days (\\( H_T = H_1 + H_2 \\)).
