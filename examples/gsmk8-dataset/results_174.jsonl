{"question": "If the wages of 15 workers for 6 days is $9450. What would be the wages for 19 workers for 5 days?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) be the wages, \\( N \\) be the number of workers, and \\( D \\) be the number of days. The equation to find the wages for \\( N \\) workers for \\( D \\) days is given by:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{{W_p \\times N \\times D}}{{N_1 \\times D_1}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the wages (\\( W \\)) is equal to the pay per worker per day (\\( W_p \\)) multiplied by the number of workers (\\( N \\)) and the number of days (\\( D \\)), divided by the base number of workers (\\( N_1 \\)) and base number of days (\\( D_1 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- The wages for 15 workers for 6 days (\\( W = 9450 \\))\n- The number of workers (\\( N = 15 \\))\n- The number of days (\\( D = 6 \\))\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{{9450 \\times 15 \\times 6}}{{15 \\times 6}} \\]\n\\[ W = \\frac{{9450 \\times 90}}{{90}} \\]\n\\[ W = 9450 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wages for 15 workers for 6 days is $9450.\n\nWe want to find the wages for 19 workers for 5 days. This is equivalent to one worker working for \\( 19 \\times 5 = 95 \\) days. Using the same pay per worker per day, we can calculate the wages:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{{9450 \\times 1 \\times 95}}{{90}} \\]\n\\[ W = 9975 \\]\n\nTherefore, the wages for 19 workers for 5 days would be $9975.\n#### 9975"}

{"question": "A pastry chef is making brownies but is running out of butter.  The recipe he is following calls for 2 ounces of butter for every 1 cup of baking mix; however, it allows 2 ounces of coconut oil to be substituted for the 2 ounces of butter if necessary.

Let \\( O \\) represent the number of ounces of coconut oil required. The equation to find the number of ounces of coconut oil required is given by:\n\n\\[ O = 2(M - \\frac{B}{2}) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of ounces of coconut oil required (\\( O \\)) is equal to 2 times the difference between the number of cups of baking mix (\\( M \\)) and half of the remaining ounces of butter (\\( \\frac{B}{2} \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 4 \\) ounces (remaining ounces of butter)\n- \\( M = 6 \\) cups (cups of baking mix)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ O = 2(6 - \\frac{4}{2}) \\]\n\\[ O = 2(6 - 2) \\]\n\\[ O = 2(4) \\]\n\\[ O = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the chef will end up using 8 ounces of coconut oil.####\n8"}
{"question": "For the first hour of work, Manolo can make face-masks at the rate of one every four minutes. Thereafter, he can make face-masks at the rate of one every six minutes.

Therefore, the number of face-masks made in the first hour (\\( F_1 \\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ F_1 = \\frac{60}{4} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of face-masks made in the first hour (\\( F_1 \\)) is equal to 60 divided by 4, which represents the number of four-minute intervals in 60 minutes.\n\nIn subsequent hours, Manolo can make one face-mask every six minutes.
