{"question": "A craft store makes a third of its sales in the fabric section, a quarter of its sales in the jewelry section, and the rest in the stationery section. They made 36 sales today. How many sales were in the stationery section?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the total number of sales made by the craft store, \\( F \\) represent the number of sales made in the fabric section, \\( J \\) represent the number of sales made in the jewelry section, and \\( St \\) represent the number of sales made in the stationery section. We can express the number of sales in each section as a fraction of the total sales:\n\n- Sales in fabric section: \\( \\frac{1}{3}S \\)\n- Sales in jewelry section: \\( \\frac{1}{4}S \\)\n- Sales in stationery section: \\( S - \\frac{1}{3}S - \\frac{1}{4}S \\)\n\nThe equation to find the number of sales in the stationery section is given by:\n\n\\[ St = S - \\frac{1}{3}S - \\frac{1}{4}S \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of sales in the stationery section (\\( St \\)) is the difference between the total number of sales (\\( S \\)) and the number of sales in the fabric section (\\( \\frac{1}{3}S \\)) and the number of sales in the jewelry section (\\( \\frac{1}{4}S \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = 36 \\) sales (total sales made by the craft store)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ St = 36 - \\frac{1}{3} \\times 36 - \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 \\]\n\\[ St = 36 - 12 - 9 \\]\n\\[ St = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, there were 15 sales in the stationery section.\n####\n15"}
{"question": "Marcy is a makeup artist and has agreed to do some makeup for her friend's wedding. The only makeup she has limited stock of is lip gloss so she counts how many tubes she needs. Each tube of lip gloss will hold enough lip gloss for 3 people's makeup. Marcy decides to bring 6 tubs of lip gloss, each of which holds 2 tubes of lip gloss, and this will be the exact amount she needs for everyone's makeup. How many people is Marcy painting with makeup?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the number of people Marcy is painting with makeup.\n\nGiven:\n- Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss, and each tub holds 2 tubes of lip gloss.\n\nTo find the number of people Marcy is painting with makeup, we can calculate the total number of tubes of lip gloss she has and multiply it by the number of people each tube can accommodate. The equation is:\n\n\\[ P = \\text{{total number of tubes of lip gloss}} \\times \\text{{number of people per tube of lip gloss}} \\]\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P = 6 \\text{{ tubs of lip gloss}} \\times 2 \\text{{ tubes of lip gloss per tub}} \\]\n\\[ P = 12 \\text{{ tubes of lip gloss}} \\times 3 \\text{{ people per tube of lip gloss}} \\]\n\\[ P = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marcy is painting makeup for 36 people.\n####\n36"}

{"question": "Janice can type 6 sentences per minute. Today at work, Janice continued working on a paper she started typing yesterday. She typed for 20 minutes, took a break, and typed 15 minutes longer. She then had to erase 40 sentences she had typed incorrectly. After a meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. In all, the paper had 536 sentences by the end of today. How many sentences did she start with today?", "answer": "Let \\( X \\) represent the number of sentences Janice had from yesterday already typed to start with today. We can break down the problem into the following steps:\n\n1. Janice typed for 20 minutes before her break, typing at a rate of 6 sentences per minute. Therefore, she typed \\( 6 \\times 20 \\) sentences before her break.\n2. After her break, Janice typed for 15 minutes longer. Since she types at a rate of 6 sentences per minute, she typed \\( 6 \\times 15 \\) sentences after her break.\n3. Janice had a meeting, and after the meeting, she typed for 18 minutes more. Again, typing at a rate of 6 sentences per minute, she typed \\( 6 \\times 18 \\) sentences after her meeting.\n4. In total, Janice typed \\( 120 + 90 + 108 \\) sentences today.\n5. However, Janice had to erase 40 sentences that she had typed incorrectly, leaving her with \\( 318 - 40 \\) sentences that she typed today.\n6. At the end of today, the paper had \\( X + 278 \\) sentences.\n7. Thus, we can set up the equation \\( X + 278 = 536 \\) to represent the number of sentences on the paper at the end of today.\n8. Solving for \\( X \\), we have \\( X = 536 - 278 \\).\n\nApplying these steps to the given values:\n\n\\[ X = 536 - 278 \\]\n\\[ X = 258 \\]\n\nTherefore, Janice had 258 sentences typed on the paper to start with today. \n####\n258"}
{"question": "During one day, there are 4 boat trips through the lake. The boat can take up to 12 people during one trip.

The equation to find the total number of people \\( P_t \\) the boat can transport in \\( T \\) days is given by:\n\n\\[ P_t = P \\times 4 \\times T \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of people (\\( P_t \\)) the boat can transport in \\( T \\) days is the product of the maximum number of people the boat can transport during one trip (\\( P \\)), 4 (representing the 4 boat trips in one day), and \\( T \\) (the number of days).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 12 \\) people (maximum number of people the boat can transport during one trip)\n- \\( T = 2 \\) days (number of days)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_t = 12 \\times 4 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ P_t = 48 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ P_t = 96 \\]\n\nTherefore, the boat can transport a total of 96 people in 2 days.\n####\n96"}
