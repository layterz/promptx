{"question": "Karen is constantly trying to stop the raccoons from getting in her trash. The first lock she tries stalls them for 5 minutes. The next lock stalls them for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock. When Karen tries both locks at once, it stalled the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone. How long is that?", "answer": "Let \\(L_1\\) represent the duration of the first lock, \\(L_2\\) represent the duration of the second lock, and \\(L_3\\) represent the duration of both locks combined. \n\nThe problem states that the second lock stalls the raccoons for 3 minutes less than three times as long as the first lock. Therefore, we can express \\(L_2\\) as \\(3L_1-3\\). \n\nThe problem also states that when both locks are used together, it stalls the raccoons for five times as long as the second lock alone. Therefore, we can express \\(L_3\\) as \\(5L_2\\). \n\nGiven that \\(L_1=5\\) minutes, we can substitute the value into the equations to find \\(L_2\\) and \\(L_3\\). \n\n\\(L_2 = 3 \\times 5 - 3\\) \n\n\\(L_2 = 12\\) minutes \n\n\\(L_3 = 5 \\times 12\\) \n\n\\(L_3 = 60\\) \n\nTherefore, the third lock stalls the raccoons for 60 minutes when used alone. \n####\n60"}
{"question": "Brian is taping up some boxes. Each box needs three pieces of tape, one as long as the long side and two as long as the short side. If Brian tapes up 5 boxes that measure 15 inches by 30 inches and 2 boxes that measure 40 inches square, how much tape does he need?", "answer": "Let \\(L\\) represent the length of a box, \\(W\\) represent the width of a box, \\(N\\) represent the number of boxes of a certain size, and \\(T\\) represent the amount of tape needed. \n\nFor each box that measures 15 inches by 30 inches, the amount of tape needed on the short sides is \\(2 \\times W\\) inches. So, the total amount of tape needed per box is \\(2 \\times 15\\) inches. \n\nFor each box that measures 40 inches square, the amount of tape needed for the three equal length sides is \\(3 \\times L\\) inches.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tape needed for the 5 boxes that measure 15 inches by 30 inches is \\(2 \\times 15\\) inches multiplied by 5 boxes. \n\nThe total amount of tape needed for the 2 boxes that measure 40 inches square is \\(3 \\times 40\\) inches multiplied by 2 boxes. \n\nAdding the total amounts of tape needed for each box size will give us the grand total.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(L = 15\\) inches (length of a box that measures 15 inches by 30 inches)\n- \\(W = 30\\) inches (width of a box that measures 15 inches by 30 inches)\n- \\(N = 5\\) (number of boxes that measure 15 inches by 30 inches)\n- \\(L = W = 40\\) inches (length and width of a box that measures 40 inches square)\n- \\(N = 2\\) (number of boxes that measure 40 inches square)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[T = (2 \\times W) \\times N + (3 \\times L) \\times N\\]\n\\[T = (2 \\times 15) \\times 5 + (3 \\times 40) \\times 2\\]\n\\[T = 30 \\times 5 + 120 \\times 2\\]\n\\[T = 150 + 240\\]\n\\[T = 390\\]\n\nTherefore, Brian needs 390 inches of tape. \n####\n390"}
{"question": "Three friends agreed to pay an equal amount of money for buying 5 bags of chips.

The equation to find the cost of each bag of chips \\( C \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ C = \frac{{\\text{{Total cost of bags of chips}}}}{{\\text{{Total number of bags of chips}}}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the cost of each bag of chips is equal to the total cost of bags of chips divided by the total number of bags of chips.\n\nGiven:\n- Total cost of bags of chips = $5 x 3 = $15 (since each friend paid $5)\n- Total number of bags of chips = 5\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C = \frac{{\\$15}}{{5}} \\]\n\\[ C = \\$3 \\]\n\nTherefore, each bag of chips costs $3.\n####\n3"}

{"question": "There were 30 women and 20 men who attended the party. After few hours, 2/5 of the total number of people left. If 9 men left the party, how many more women stayed at the party than men?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) represent the number of women who attended the party and \\( M \\) represent the number of men who attended the party. The number of people who attended the party is given by:\n\n\\[ T = W + M \\]\n\nAfter a few hours, \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the total number of people left the party. This can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{5}T \\]\n\nSince 9 men left the party, the number of women who left can be calculated as \\( \\frac{2}{5}T - 9 \\).

The equation to find the total cost of cable \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = (D_{ew} + D_{ns}) \\times C \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total cost of cable (\\( T \\)) is the sum of the distances of the east-west streets (\\( D_{ew} \\)) and the north-south streets (\\( D_{ns} \\)), multiplied by the cost of one mile of cable (\\( C \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D_{ew} = 18 \\) streets (east-west streets)\n- \\( D_{ns} = 10 \\) streets (north-south streets)\n- \\( C = \\$2000 \\) per mile (cost of one mile of cable)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = (18 + 10) \\times 2000 \\]\n\\[ T = 28 \\times 2000 \\]\n\\[ T = 56000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of cable for the neighborhood is $560,000. \n####\n560000"}
