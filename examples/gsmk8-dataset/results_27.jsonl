{"question": "Whitney bought 9 books about whales and 7 books about fish. She also bought 3 magazines. Each book cost $11 and each magazine cost $1. How much did Whitney spend in all?", "answer": "Let \\( B_w \\) represent the number of books about whales, \\( B_f \\) represent the number of books about fish, \\( M \\) represent the number of magazines, \\( C_b \\) represent the cost of each book, and \\( C_m \\) represent the cost of each magazine. The total cost \\( C_t \\) that Whitney spent in all is given by:\n\n\\[ C_t = (B_w + B_f) \\times C_b + M \\times C_m \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B_w = 9 \\) books (books about whales)\n- \\( B_f = 7 \\) books (books about fish)\n- \\( M = 3 \\) magazines\n- \\( C_b = \\$11 \\) (cost of each book)\n- \\( C_m = \\$1 \\) (cost of each magazine)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_t = (9 + 7) \\times 11 + 3 \\times 1 \\]\n\\[ C_t = 16 \\times 11 + 3 \\]\n\\[ C_t = 176 + 3 \\]\n\\[ C_t = 179 \\]\n\nTherefore, Whitney spent a total of $179 in all. \n####\n179"}
{"question": "Justin and Sabrina at Pine Grove Elementary have 50 pencils combined. Justin has 8 more than twice as many pencils as Sabrina. How many pencils does Sabrina have?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent the number of pencils Justin has and \\( S \\) represent the number of pencils Sabrina has. We are given that Justin has 8 more than twice as many pencils as Sabrina, so \\( J = 2S + 8 \\). We also know that Justin and Sabrina have a combined total of 50 pencils, so \\( J + S = 50 \\). \n\nTo solve for the number of pencils Sabrina has, we can substitute the value of \\( J \\) from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\( (2S + 8) + S = 50 \\)\n\\( 3S + 8 = 50 \\)\n\\( 3S = 50 - 8 \\)\n\\( 3S = 42 \\)\n\\( S = \\frac{42}{3} \\)\n\\( S = 14 \\)\n\nTherefore, Sabrina has 14 pencils. \n####\n14"}
