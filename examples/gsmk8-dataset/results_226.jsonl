{"question": "Steve has 2 boxes of pencils with 12 pencils in each box. He gave Matt 3 more pencils than he gave to Lauren. If Steve gave 6 pencils to Lauren, how many pencils does he have left?", "answer": "Let \\(P\\) represent the total number of pencils that Steve has, \\(M\\) represent the number of pencils given to Matt, and \\(L\\) represent the number of pencils given to Lauren.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- Steve has 2 boxes of pencils with 12 pencils in each box, so \\(P = 2 \\times 12\\).\n- Steve gave Matt 3 more pencils than he gave to Lauren, so \\(M = L + 3\\).\n- Steve gave 6 pencils to Lauren.\n\nUsing the given information, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[P - M - L = P - (L + 3) - L\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation, we have:\n\n\\[P - M - L = P - 2L - 3\\]\n\nPlugging in the values we know, we have:\n\n\\[P - M - L = 24 - 2L - 3\\]\n\nNow we can solve for the number of pencils Steve has left:\n\n\\[P - M - L = 21 - 2L\\]\n\nSince we know that Steve gave Lauren 6 pencils, we can substitute \\(L = 6\\) into the equation:\n\n21 - 2(6) = 21 - 12 = 9\n\nTherefore, Steve has 9 pencils left. \n\n#### 9"}
{"question": "Charlotte, Lisa, and Patricia have a joint baseball collection. One of their friends is selling a rare baseball card for $100 on his website. Not wanting to miss such a rare opportunity, they have pooled all their money to buy the card. Patricia has $6. Lisa has five times Patricia\u2019s money, but double Charlotte\u2019s.

The equation to find the total amount of money \\( T \\) they have is given by:\n\n\\[ T = P + L + C \\]\n\nSince Lisa has five times Patricia's money and Patricia's money is double Charlotte's, we can express Lisa's money as \\( 5P \\) and Charlotte's money as \\( \\frac{P}{2} \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = P + 5P + \\frac{P}{2} \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{2}{2}P + \\frac{10}{2}P + \\frac{P}{2} \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{13}{2}P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount of money they have (\\( T \\)) is 6.5 times Patricia's money (\\( P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 6 \\) dollars (Patricia's money)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{13}{2} \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ T = 6.5 \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ T = 39 \\]\n\nTherefore, they have a total of 39 dollars.\n\nTo find out how much more money they require, we subtract the total amount of money they have from the cost of the rare card:\n\n\\[ \\text{Additional money required} = 100 - 39 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Additional money required} = 61 \\]\n\nTherefore, they require an additional 61 dollars.####\n49"}
