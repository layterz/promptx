{"question": "Sandy's monthly phone bill expense is equal to ten times her age now. In two years, Sandy will be three times as old as Kim. If Kim is currently 10 years old, calculate Sandy's monthly phone bill expense.", "answer": "Let \\(S\\) represent Sandy's age, and \\(B\\) represent Sandy's monthly phone bill expense. We are given:\n\n- Kim's age in two years, \\(K+2\\), which is three times Kim's current age\n- Kim's current age, \\(K\\), is 10 years old\n\nFrom here, we can determine Sandy's age:\n\n\\[S + 2 = 3(K + 2)\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(K = 10\\):\n\n\\[S + 2 = 3(10 + 2)\\]\n\\[S + 2 = 3(12)\\]\n\\[S + 2 = 36\\]\n\\[S = 34\\]\n\nTherefore, Sandy is currently 34 years old.\n\nSandy's monthly phone bill expense is equal to ten times her age now:\n\n\\[B = 10S\\]\n\\[B = 10(34)\\]\n\\[B = 340\\]\n\nTherefore, Sandy's monthly phone bill expense is $340."}
