{"question": "Bridget counted 14 shooting stars in the night sky.  Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than did Bridget, but Sam counted four more shooting stars than did Reginald.  How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the number of shooting stars counted by Bridget, \\( R \\) represent the number of shooting stars counted by Reginald, and \\( S \\) represent the number of shooting stars counted by Sam.\n\nWe are given that:\n- Bridget counted 14 shooting stars (\\( B = 14 \\)).\n- Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget (\\( R = B - 2 \\)).\n- Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald (\\( S = R + 4 \\)).\n\nTo find the number of shooting stars Sam counted more than the average number observed for the three of them, we need to calculate the average first. The average number of shooting stars (\\( A \\)) observed for the three of them is given by:\n\n\\[ A = \frac{B + R + S}{3} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\( B, R, \\) and \\( S \\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ A = \frac{14 + (14 - 2) + (14 - 2 + 4)}{3} \\]\n\\[ A = \frac{14 + 12 + 16}{3} \\]\n\\[ A = \frac{42}{3} \\]\n\\[ A = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them is 14.\n\nTo find the number of shooting stars Sam counted more than the average, we subtract the average from the number of shooting stars Sam counted:\n\n\\[ S - A = 16 - 14 \\]\n\\[ S - A = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sam counted 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed for the three of them.\n####\n2"}
