{"question": "Martha buys 1 latte for $4.00 every morning, 5 days a week.  3 days a week, she buys an iced coffee for $2.00.  Her goal for the entire year is to cut her coffee spending by 25%.  How much will she save?", "answer": "Let \\( L \\) represent the cost of a latte, \\( I \\) represent the cost of an iced coffee, \\( D_L \\) represent the number of days Martha buys a latte, \\( D_I \\) represent the number of days Martha buys an iced coffee, and \\( T \\) represent the total cost of coffee for the year. The equation to find the total cost of coffee for the year is given by:\n\n\\[ T = L \\cdot D_L + I \\cdot D_I \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total cost of coffee for the year (\\( T \\)) is the cost of a latte (\\( L \\)) multiplied by the number of days Martha buys a latte (\\( D_L \\)), plus the cost of an iced coffee (\\( I \\)) multiplied by the number of days Martha buys an iced coffee (\\( D_I \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( L = \\$4.00 \\) (cost of a latte)\n- \\( I = \\$2.00 \\) (cost of an iced coffee)\n- \\( D_L = 5 \\) (number of days Martha buys a latte)\n- \\( D_I = 3 \\) (number of days Martha buys an iced coffee)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\$4.00 \\cdot 5 + \\$2.00 \\cdot 3 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$20.00 + \\$6.00 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$26.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Martha spends a total of \\$26.00 on coffee in one week.\n\nTo find the total cost for the year, we multiply the cost per week by the number of weeks in a year:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{year}} = \\$26.00 \\cdot 52 \\]\n\\[ T_{\\text{year}} = \\$1,352.00 \\]\n\nMartha wants to cut her coffee spending by 25%, so we calculate the savings as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Savings} = 0.25 \\cdot T_{\\text{year}} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Savings} = 0.25 \\cdot \\$1,352.00 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Savings} = \\$338.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Martha will save \\$338.00 by cutting her coffee spending by 25%.\n#### 338"}
{"question": "Benny is baking pies for a bake sale. He plans to make ten pumpkin pies, which cost $3 each to make, and twelve cherry pies, which cost $5 each to make.
