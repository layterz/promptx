{"question": "Without factoring in the cost of depreciation for his car John made $30,000 doing Uber.  When he finally traded in the car he bought for $18,000 he got $6000 back.  What was his profit from driving Uber?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the cost of John's car, \\( R \\) represent the amount received when he traded in the car, and \\( P \\) represent his profit from driving Uber. The formula to calculate his profit is given by:\n\n\\[ P = R - (C - R) \\]\n\nThis equation states that his profit (\\( P \\)) is the amount received when he traded in the car (\\( R \\)) minus the difference between the cost of the car (\\( C \\)) and the amount received (\\( R \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 18000 \\) (cost of the car)\n- \\( R = 6000 \\) (amount received when he traded in the car)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P = 6000 - (18000 - 6000) \\]\n\\[ P = 6000 - 12000 \\]\n\\[ P = -6000 \\]\n\nTherefore, his profit from driving Uber is -6000.####\n-6000"}
