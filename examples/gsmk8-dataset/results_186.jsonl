{"question": "There are 10 books on the table. Two-fifths of them are reading books and three-tenths of them are math books. There is one fewer science book than math books and the rest are history books. How many history books are there?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of books on the table, \\( R \\) represent the number of reading books, \\( M \\) represent the number of math books, \\( S \\) represent the number of science books, and \\( H \\) represent the number of history books. The total number of books can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ T = R + M + S + H \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 10 \\) books (total number of books)\n- \\( R = \\frac{2}{5}T = 4 \\) books (reading books)\n- \\( M = \\frac{3}{10}T = 3 \\) books (math books)\n- \\( S = M - 1 = 2 \\) books (science books)\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n\\[ 10 = 4 + 3 + 2 + H \\]\n\\[ H = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, there is only 1 history book on the table.\n####\n1"}
{"question": "Jake decides to go to the beach for a fun day.  It is a 2-hour drive each way.  He then spends 2.5 times at long at the beach as his total driving time.

The total trip time \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = D + B \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D = 2 \\) hours (time for driving each way)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 2 + B \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( B \\), we know that \\( B \\) is \\( 2.5 \\) times the total driving time (\\( D \\)). So we can express \\( B \\) as \\( 2.5D \\). Replacing \\( B \\) with \\( 2.5D \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 2 + 2.5D \\]\n\nSince we know that the driving time (\\( D \\)) is \\( 2 \\) hours, we can substitute the value of \\( D \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 2 + 2.5 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ T = 2 + 5 \\]\n\\[ T = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total trip took 7 hours.\n####\n7"}
