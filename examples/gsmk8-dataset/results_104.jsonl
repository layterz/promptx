{"question": "If 100 pieces, each 15 centimeters long, are cut from a 51-meter long ribbon, how much ribbon remains ?", "answer": "Let \\(L\\) represent the length of the ribbon, \\(N\\) represent the number of pieces cut, and \\(C\\) represent the length of each piece. The equation to find the remaining length of the ribbon \\(R\\) is given by:\n\n\\[R = L - (N \\times C)\\]\n\nThis equation states that the remaining length of the ribbon (\\(R\\)) is equal to the total length of the ribbon (\\(L\\)) minus the total length cut from the ribbon (\\(N \\times C\\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(L = 51\\) meters (length of the ribbon)\n- \\(N = 100\\) pieces (number of pieces cut)\n- \\(C = 15\\) centimeters (length of each piece)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[R = 51 - (100 \\times 15)\\]\n\\[R = 51 - 1500\\]\n\\[R = 36\\]\n\nTherefore, 36 meters of ribbon remains. \n####\n36"}
