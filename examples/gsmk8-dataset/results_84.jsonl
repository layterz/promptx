{"question": "A pole is 20 meters long. It got cut in a way that left it 30% shorter. How long is the pole?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the original length of the pole, and \\( P_c \\) represent the length of the cut-away part of the pole. The remaining length of the pole is given by:\n\n\\[ P_r = P - P_c \\]\n\nSince the cut-away part is 30% of the original length, we can express \\( P_c \\) as \\( \\frac{30}{100} \\times P \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ P_r = P - \\frac{30}{100} \\times P \\]\n\\[ P_r = P \\left( 1 - \\frac{30}{100} \\right) \\]\n\\[ P_r = P \\left( 1 - 0.30 \\right) \\]\n\\[ P_r = P \\times 0.70 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the remaining length of the pole (\\( P_r \\)) is 70% of the original length of the pole (\\( P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 20 \\) meters (original length of the pole)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_r = 20 \\times 0.70 \\]\n\\[ P_r = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the length of the pole left after the cut is 14 meters.\n####\n14"}
