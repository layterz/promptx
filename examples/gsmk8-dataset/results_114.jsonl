Therefore, \\(Q = 2 \\cdot A\\).\n- Bret catches three times the amount of frogs as Quinn. Therefore, \\(B = 3 \\cdot Q\\).\n\nWe can substitute the value of \\(Q\\) from the first equation into the second equation to solve for \\(B\\):\n\n\\(B = 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot A)\\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\(B = 6 \\cdot A\\)\n\nNow, we can substitute the given value of \\(A\\) into the equation to find the value of \\(B\\):\n\n\\(B = 6 \\cdot 2\\)\n\n\\(B = 12\\)\n\nTherefore, Bret caught 12 frogs.\n#### 12"}
{"question": "Gunner has a box of mittens with 20 fewer pairs than a box of plugs. He decides to put 30 more pairs of plugs into the box of plugs. If the box of mittens has 150 pairs of mittens, how many plugs are there?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) represent the number of pairs of mittens and \\( P \\) represent the number of pairs of plugs. \n\nFrom the information given, we know that there are 20 fewer pairs of mittens than plugs, so we can express this as:\n\\( M = P - 20 \\)\n\nWe are also told that there are 150 pairs of mittens, so we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\\( 150 = P - 20 \\)\n\nSolving this equation for \\( P \\):\n\\( P = 150 + 20 \\)\n\\( P = 170 \\)\n\nNext, we are told that Gunner decides to add 30 more pairs of plugs into the box.
