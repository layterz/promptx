{"question": "Whenever Katie and her family eat donuts, they need some coffee to dunk them in. She notices that for each donut they need 2 ounces of coffee. Every pot of coffee she makes contains 12 ounces and costs $3 to make. If her family finishes 3 dozen donuts, how much do they spend on coffee?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) be the number of donuts eaten by Katie's family, and \\( C \\) be the amount of coffee needed in ounces. The amount of coffee needed \\( C \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ C = 2D \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount of coffee needed (\\( C \\)) is twice the number of donuts eaten (\\( D \\)).\n\nThe cost of making a pot of coffee is $3. The total cost \\( T \\) of making all the coffee needed can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{C}{12} \\times 3 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total cost of making all the coffee needed (\\( T \\)) is equal to the number of pots of coffee made (\\( \\frac{C}{12} \\)) multiplied by the cost per pot of coffee ($3).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D = 3 \\) dozen donuts (36 donuts)\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n\\[ C = 2 \\times 36 \\]\n\\[ C = 72 \\]\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{72}{12} \\times 3 \\]\n\\[ T = 6 \\times 3 \\]\n\\[ T = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, Katie's family spends $18 on coffee. \n####\n18"}
