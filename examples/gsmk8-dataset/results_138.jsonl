{"question": "Baseball season opened up with the Chicago Cubs at home at Wrigley Field. They scored 2 home runs in the third inning, 1 home run in the fifth inning and 2 more home runs in the eighth inning. Their opponents, the Cardinals, scored 1 home run in the second inning and 1 home run in the fifth inning. How many more home runs did the Chicago Cubs score than the Cardinals in the game?", "answer": "Let \\( C_T \\) represent the total number of home runs scored by the Chicago Cubs in the game, and \\( C \\) represent the number of home runs scored by the Cardinals in the game. The number of home runs scored by the Chicago Cubs in the game (\\( C_C \\)) can be calculated by summing the home runs scored in each inning. Similarly, the number of home runs scored by the Cardinals in the game (\\( C_C \\)) can be calculated by summing the home runs scored in each inning. The difference between \\( C_C \\) and \\( C_C \\) will give us the number of more home runs scored by the Chicago Cubs than the Cardinals in the game.\n\nGiven:\n- The Chicago Cubs scored 2 home runs in the third inning, 1 home run in the fifth inning, and 2 home runs in the eighth inning for a combined total of \\( 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 \\) home runs for the game.\n- The Cardinals scored 1 home run in the second inning and 1 home run in the fifth inning for a combined total of \\( 1 + 1 = 2 \\) home runs for the game.\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C = C_C - C_C \\]\n\\[ C = 5 - 2 \\]\n\\[ C = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Chicago Cubs scored 3 more home runs than the Cardinals in the game.\n####\n3"}
