{"question": "There are 4 alligators living on a golf course in Florida. If the number of alligators doubles every six months, how many alligators will there be at the end of a year?", "answer": "Let \\( A \\) represent the initial number of alligators and \\( P \\) represent the population of alligators at the end of a year. \n\nThe population of alligators doubles every six months, so the number of times the population doubles in one year can be found by dividing the number of months in a year (12 months) by the number of months it takes for the population to double (6 months):\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of times the population doubles} = \\frac{12 \\text{ months}}{6 \\text{ months}} = 2 \\]\n\nTo calculate the population of alligators at the end of a year, we can double the population starting from the initial number of alligators:\n\n\\[ P = A \\times 2^n \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of times the population doubles.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A = 4 \\) alligators (initial number of alligators)\n- \\( n = 2 \\) (number of times the population doubles)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P = 4 \\times 2^2 \\]\n\\[ P = 4 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ P = 16 \\]\n\nTherefore, there will be 16 alligators at the end of a year. \n####\n16"}
