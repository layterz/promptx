{"question": "Jillian had 80 oranges which she had bought to give to her friends. She divided each orange into ten equal pieces for each friend to get four pieces. How many friends were there?", "answer": "Let \\( O \\) be the number of oranges Jillian had and \\( F \\) be the number of friends she had. The equation to find the number of friends \\( F \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ O \\times 10 = F \\times 4 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of pieces of orange (\\( O \\times 10 \\)) is equal to the number of friends (\\( F \\)) times the number of pieces each friend received (4).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( O = 80 \\) oranges (number of oranges Jillian had)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 80 \\times 10 = F \\times 4 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ 800 = 4F \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{800}{4} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ F = 200 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jillian had 200 friends.####\n200"}
