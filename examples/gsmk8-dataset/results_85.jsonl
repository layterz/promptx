{"question": "Jon's laundry machine can do 5 pounds of laundry at a time.  4 shirts weigh 1 pound and 2 pairs of pants weigh 1 pound.  If he needs to wash 20 shirts and 20 pants, how many loads of laundry does he have to do?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the number of shirts, \\( P \\) represent the number of pants, and \\( L \\) represent the number of loads of laundry. \n\nFrom the information given, we can determine the weight of the shirts and pants:\n\n- Each shirt weighs \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) pound. So the weight of the shirts is \\( \\frac{S}{4} \\) pounds.\n- Each pair of pants weighs \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) pound. So the weight of the pants is \\( \\frac{P}{2} \\) pounds.\n\nThe total weight of laundry is the sum of the weights of the shirts and pants:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{S}{4} + \\frac{P}{2} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = 20 \\) shirts\n- \\( P = 20 \\) pants\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{20}{4} + \\frac{20}{2} \\]\n\\[ W = 5 + 10 \\]\n\\[ W = 15 \\]\n\nSo, Jon needs to do 15 pounds of laundry. Since his laundry machine can do 5 pounds of laundry at a time, he needs to do \\( \\frac{15}{5} \\) loads of laundry.\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{15}{5} \\]\n\\[ L = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jon needs to do 3 loads of laundry to wash 20 shirts and 20 pants.\n####\n3"}
{"question": "Thomas is training at the gym to prepare for a competition. He trained for 5 hours every day for a month (30 days).
