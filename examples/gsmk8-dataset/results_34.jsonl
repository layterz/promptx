{"question": "Claire wants to make 2 cakes for her mother. Two packages of flour are required for making a cake. If 1 package of flour is $3, how much does she pay for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) be the number of packages of flour needed to make 2 cakes, and \\( C \\) be the cost of 1 package of flour. The total cost \\( T \\) for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes can be determined using the equation:\n\n\\[ T = P \\times C \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 2 \\) packages of flour (required for making a cake)\n- \\( C = \\$3 \\) (cost of 1 package of flour)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 2 \\times 3 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Claire pays \\$6 for the flour that is enough to make 2 cakes. ####\n6"}
{"question": "Ann is 6 years old. Her brother Tom is now two times older.

{"question": "Alden had 50 nephews ten years ago. This is half the number of nephews Alden has now. If Vihaan has 60 more nephews than Alden now, how many nephews do the two have altogether?", "answer": "Let \\( N_0 \\) represent the number of nephews Alden had ten years ago, and \\( N \\) represent the number of nephews Alden has now. Let \\( V \\) represent the number of nephews Vihaan has now. The total number of nephews \\( N_T \\) that the two have altogether is given by:\n\n\\[ N_T = N + V \\]\n\nSince \\( N_0 \\) is half the number of nephews Alden has now, we can express \\( N_0 \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2} N \\).
