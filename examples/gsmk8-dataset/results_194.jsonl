How many miles apart are each of the consecutive checkpoints between the start-finish line?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the total distance of the marathon, \\( D_{sf} \\) represents the distance between the start and finish lines, and \\( D_c \\) represents the distance between consecutive checkpoints. \n\nThe distance between the start and finish lines (\\( D_{sf} \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ D_{sf} = D - 1 - 1 \\]\n\nSince there are 4 equally spaced checkpoints, the distance between consecutive checkpoints (\\( D_c \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ D_c = \\frac{{D_{sf}}}{{4}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D = 26 \\) miles (total distance of the marathon)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\[ D_{sf} = 26 - 1 - 1 \\]\n\\[ D_{sf} = 24 \\]\n\n\\[ D_c = \\frac{{24}}{{4}} \\]\n\\[ D_c = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, each of the consecutive checkpoints between the start and finish line are 6 miles apart.\n####\n6"}
{"question": "Buffy has a sailboat with a planing hull that she sails in the Gulf of Mexico.  Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots.  A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles.  If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?", "answer": "Let \\( D_1 \\) represent the distance traveled with one sail and \\( D_2 \\) represent the distance traveled with two sails.
