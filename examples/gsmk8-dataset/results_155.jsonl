{"question": "4 students participated in a 200m race. If the average completion time of the last three students was 35 seconds, and the average completion time of all four runners was 30 seconds, how long (in seconds) did it take the student who came first to finish the race?", "answer": "Let \\( C_1 \\) represent the completion time of the student who came first, \\( C_2 \\) represent the completion time of the second student, \\( C_3 \\) represent the completion time of the third student, and \\( C_4 \\) represent the completion time of the fourth student. \n\nWe are given that the average completion time of the last three students is 35 seconds, so the sum of their completion times is \\( 3 \\times 35 = 105 \\) seconds.\n\nWe are also given that the average completion time of all four runners is 30 seconds, so the sum of their completion times is \\( 4 \\times 30 = 120 \\) seconds.\n\nTo find the completion time of the student who came first (\\( C_1 \\)), we can subtract the sum of the completion times of the last three students from the sum of the completion times of all four runners:\n\n\\[ C_1 = 120 - 105 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ C_1 = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, the student who came first took 15 seconds to finish the race.\n#### 15"}
{"question": "If Katherine has 4 apples and 3 times as many pears in her fridge, how many bananas does she have if she has a total of 21 pieces of fruit?", "answer": "Let \\( A \\) represent the number of apples Katherine has, \\( P \\) represent the number of pears she has, and \\( B \\) represent the number of bananas she has. The total number of pieces of fruit \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = A + P + B \\]\n\nGiven that Katherine has 4 apples and 3 times as many pears, we can express the number of pears as \\( 3A \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = A + 3A + B \\]\n\\[ T = 4A + B \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of pieces of fruit (\\( T \\)) is 4 times the number of apples (\\( A \\)) plus the number of bananas (\\( B \\)).\n\nWe also know that Katherine has a total of 21 pieces of fruit. Applying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 21 = 4 \\times 4 + B \\]\n\\[ 21 = 16 + B \\]\n\\[ B = 21 - 16 \\]\n\\[ B = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Katherine has 5 bananas.####\n5"}
{"question": "Peter is raking leaves. It takes him 15 minutes to rake 3 bags of leaves. If he keeps raking at the same rate, how long will it take him to rake 8 bags?", "answer": "Let \\( Y \\) represent the time it takes Peter to rake 8 bags of leaves. We can express this using the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{{3 \\text{{ bags of leaves}}}}{{15 \\text{{ minutes}}}} = \\frac{{8 \\text{{ bags of leaves Y}}}}{{Y \\text{{ minutes}}}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the ratio of the number of bags of leaves to the time it takes to rake them is constant. We can solve for \\( Y \\) by cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[ 3Y = 15 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ 3Y = 120 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( Y \\), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n\n\\[ \\frac{{3Y}}{{3}} = \\frac{{120}}{{3}} \\]\n\\[ Y = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Peter 40 minutes to rake 8 bags of leaves."}
{"question": "Lovely cuts her birthday cake into 12 equal pieces. Only one-fourth of the cake was eaten by her visitors and the rest were kept. How many slices of cake were kept?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the total number of slices in Lovely's birthday cake, and let \\( S_e \\) represent the number of slices eaten by her visitors. The number of slices of cake kept is given by:\n\n\\[ S_k = C - S_e \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of slices kept (\\( S_k \\)) is equal to the total number of slices (\\( C \\)) minus the number of slices eaten (\\( S_e \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 12 \\) slices (total number of cake slices)\n- \\( S_e = 12/4 = 3 \\) slices (slices eaten by visitors, which is one-fourth of the cake)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S_k = 12 - 3 \\]\n\\[ S_k = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lovely kept 9 slices of cake.####\n9"}
