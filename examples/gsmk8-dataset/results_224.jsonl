{"question": "Roberto is out for a hike. He travels uphill at 2 MPH and downhill at 3MPH. The trail is 5 miles long. 60% is uphill and the rest is downhill. How long does it take him to complete it in minutes?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the distance of the trail in miles, \\( T_u \\) represent the time taken to travel uphill, and \\( T_d \\) represent the time taken to travel downhill. The total time taken \\( T \\) to complete the trail can be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance traveled uphill. Given that 60% of the trail is uphill, we can express this as \\( 0.6D \\). Therefore, the distance traveled uphill is \\( D_u = 0.6D \\).\n\nNext, we calculate the time taken to travel uphill. Given that the speed of Roberto uphill is 2 MPH, we can use the formula \\( T = \\frac{D}{S} \\) to find \\( T_u \\):\n\n\\[ T_u = \\frac{D_u}{2} = \\frac{0.6D}{2} = 0.3D \\]\n\nWe convert this time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n\n\\[ T_u = 0.3D \\times 60 = 18D \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the distance traveled downhill. Given that 40% of the trail is downhill, we can express this as \\( 0.4D \\). Therefore, the distance traveled downhill is \\( D_d = 0.4D \\).\n\nNext, we calculate the time taken to travel downhill. Given that the speed of Roberto downhill is 3 MPH, we can use the formula \\( T = \\frac{D}{S} \\) to find \\( T_d \\):\n\n\\[ T_d = \\frac{D_d}{3} = \\frac{0.4D}{3} = \\frac{2D}{15} \\]\n\nWe convert this time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60:\n\n\\[ T_d = \\frac{2D}{15} \\times 60 = \\frac{8D}{15} \\]\n\nThe total time taken to complete the trail is the sum of the time taken uphill and the time taken downhill:\n\n\\[ T = T_u + T_d = 18D + \\frac{8D}{15} = \\frac{240D + 8D}{15} = \\frac{248D}{15} \\]\n\nGiven that the distance of the trail is 5 miles:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{248 \\times 5}{15} = \\frac{1240}{15} \\approx 82.67 \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Roberto approximately 82.67 minutes to complete the trail. #### 82.67"}
