{"question": "On a trip to visit the local museum, Mr. Gordon has taken 2/5 times more girls than boys. If their bus has a driver and an assistant, and the total number of boys on the trip is 50, calculate the total number of people on the bus considering the teacher also drives together with the students on the bus.", "answer": "Let \\( G \\) represent the number of girls on the trip and \\( B \\) represent the number of boys on the trip. The total number of people on the bus, including the driver, assistant driver, and teacher, is given by:\n\n\\[ P = G + B + 3 \\]\n\nSince the number of girls is 2/5 times more than the number of boys, we can express the number of girls as \\( G = B + \\frac{2}{5}B \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ P = B + B + \\frac{2}{5}B + 3 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{7}{5}B + 3 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of people on the bus (\\( P \\)) is 7/5 times the number of boys (\\( B \\)) plus 3.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 50 \\) (number of boys)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{7}{5} \\times 50 + 3 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{350}{5} + 3 \\]\n\\[ P = 70 + 3 \\]\n\\[ P = 73 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of people on the bus, including the driver, assistant driver, teacher, and students, is 123."}
