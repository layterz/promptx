{"question": "Herman likes to feed the birds in December, January and February.  He feeds them 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon.  How many cups of food will he need for all three months?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) represent the number of months, \\( D \\) represent the number of days in each month, and \\( C \\) represent the number of cups of food Herman needs in a day. The equation to find the total number of cups of food \\( T \\) Herman will need for all three months is given by:\n\n\\[ T = M \\times D \\times C \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of cups of food \\( T \\) is equal to the number of months \\( M \\) multiplied by the number of days in each month \\( D \\) multiplied by the number of cups of food in a day \\( C \\).\n\nGiven:\n- December has 31 days\n- January has 31 days\n- February has 28 days\n- \\( C = \\frac{1}{2} \\) cup (cups of food in a day)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 3 \\times (31 + 31 + 28) \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ T = 3 \\times 90 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ T = 135 \\]\n\nTherefore, Herman will need 135 cups of food for all three months.####\n135"}
{"question": "John works a job that offers performance bonuses.  He makes $80 a day and works for 8 hours.
