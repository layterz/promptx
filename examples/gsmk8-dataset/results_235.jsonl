{"question": "Mark is 18 years old. He has a little brother, John, who is 10 years younger. If John and Mark's parents are currently 5 times older than John, how old were they when Mark was born?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) represent Mark's age, \\( J \\) represent John's age, and \\( P \\) represent their parents' age. We know that John is 10 years younger than Mark, so we can express \\( J \\) in terms of \\( M \\) as \\( J = M - 10 \\). We also know that their parents are currently 5 times older than John, so we can express \\( P \\) in terms of \\( J \\) as \\( P = 5J \\).\n\nTo find the age of their parents when Mark was born, we need to subtract Mark's age from their current age. Since Mark is currently 18, we can express their parents' age when Mark was born (denoted as \\( P_b \\)) as \\( P_b = P - M \\).\n\nGiven:\n- Mark's age, \\( M = 18 \\) years\n- John's age, \\( J = M - 10 = 8 \\) years\n- Parents' age, \\( P = 5J = 40 \\) years\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_b = P - M \\]\n\\[ P_b = 40 - 18 \\]\n\\[ P_b = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, their parents were 22 years old when Mark was born.\n####\n22"}
