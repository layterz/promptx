{"question": "Maria buys a large bar of French soap that lasts her for 2 months.  She spends $8.00 per bar of soap.  If she wants to stock up for the entire year, how much will she spend on soap?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the number of bars of soap Maria needs for the entire year. The total amount Maria will spend on soap is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Cost per bar} \\times S \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Cost per bar = $8.00\n- Bar of soap lasts for 2 months\n\nTo calculate \\( S \\), we need to find the number of bars needed for 1 year. Since 1 year has 12 months, and each bar lasts for 2 months, we have:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{12}{2} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ S = 6 \\]\n\nNow we can calculate the total cost:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\$8.00 \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\$48.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Maria will spend a total of $48.00 on soap for the entire year.\n####\n48"}
