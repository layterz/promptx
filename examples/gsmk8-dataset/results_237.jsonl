{"question": "The result from the 40-item Statistics exam Marion and Ella took already came out. Ella got 4 incorrect answers while Marion got 6 more than half the score of Ella. What is Marion's score?", "answer": "Let \\( S_E \\) represent Ella's score and \\( S_M \\) represent Marion's score. \n\nGiven:\n- Ella got 4 incorrect answers, so her score is \\( S_E = 40 \\) items - 4 items = 36 items.\n- Marion's score is 6 more than half of Ella's score, so \\( S_M = \frac{1}{2} S_E + 6 \\).\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\( S_M = \frac{1}{2} 36 + 6 \\)\n\\( S_M = 18 + 6 \\)\n\\( S_M = 24 \\)\n\nTherefore, Marion's score is 24 items. #### 24"}

{"question": "Mike decides to develop a plot of land.  He bought 200 acres for $70 per acre.  After development, he sold half of the acreage for $200 per acre.  How much profit did he make?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the profit made by Mike.\n\nGiven:\n- The number of acres bought, \\( A_b \\), is 200 acres at $70 per acre.\n- The number of acres sold, \\( A_s \\), is half of the acreage, which is \\( \\frac{A_b}{2} \\) acres at $200 per acre.\n- The cost of buying the land is $14000.\n\nTo calculate the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the total revenue. The total revenue is the selling price of the acres sold. The selling price is the number of acres sold multiplied by the selling price per acre, which is \\( A_s \\times 200 \\).\n\nWe can express the profit equation as:\n\n\\[ P = (A_s \\times 200) - 14000 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the profit made (\\( P \\)) is the total revenue from selling the acres (\\( A_s \\times 200 \\)) minus the cost of buying the land ($14000).\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P = (100 \\times 200) - 14000 \\]\n\\[ P = 20000 - 14000 \\]\n\\[ P = 6000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mike made a profit of $6000.####\n6000"}
{"question": "There were 63 Easter eggs in the yard.  Hannah found twice as many as Helen.  How many Easter eggs did Hannah find?", "answer": "Let \\( H \\) represent the number of Easter eggs Hannah found, and \\( L \\) represent the number of Easter eggs Helen found. \n\nGiven the information that Hannah found twice as many eggs as Helen, we can express this relationship as \\( H = 2L \\). \n\nWe also know that there were a total of 63 Easter eggs in the yard. \n\nTo find the number of Easter eggs Helen found, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of units of eggs. \n\nSince there are 2 units for Hannah and 1 unit for Helen, there are a total of 2 + 1 = 3 units of eggs. \n\nThus, there are 63/3 = 21 Easter eggs per unit. \n\nIf Helen found 21 eggs, then Hannah would find 2 times that amount, which is 2 * 21 = 42 Easter eggs. \n\n#### \n42"}
