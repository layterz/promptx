{"question": "Alexis has four times as many mangoes as Dilan and Ashley combined. If Alexis has 60 mangoes, how many mangoes does all of them have combined?", "answer": "Let \\( A \\) represent the number of mangoes Alexis has, \\( D \\) represent the number of mangoes Dilan has, and \\( M \\) represent the number of mangoes Ashley has. The equation to find the total number of mangoes \\( T \\) that all of them have combined is given by:\n\n\\[ T = A + D + M \\]\n\nSince Alexis has four times the combined number of mangoes Dilan and Ashley have, we can express \\( A \\) as \\( 4(D + M) \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = 4(D + M) + D + M \\]\n\\[ T = 5(D + M) \\]\n\\[ T = 5D + 5M \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of mangoes \\( T \\) that all of them have combined is five times the sum of the number of mangoes Dilan and Ashley have (\\( D + M \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A = 60 \\) mangoes (number of mangoes Alexis has)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 5D + 5M \\]\n\\[ T = 5(D + M) \\]\n\\[ T = 5(15 + 60) \\]\n\\[ T = 5(75) \\]\n\\[ T = 75 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of mangoes that all of them have combined is 75 mangoes.\n####\n75"}
