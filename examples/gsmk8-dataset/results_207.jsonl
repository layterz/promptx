{"question": "Claudia has 122 ounces of water and is filling up cups. She has 8-ounce glasses, 5-ounce glasses, and 4-ounce glasses. If she fills six 5 ounce glasses and four 8 ounce glasses, how many 4 ounce glasses can she fill with the remaining water?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) be the total ounces of water Claudia has, \\( G_8 \\) be the number of 8-ounce glasses filled, \\( G_5 \\) be the number of 5-ounce glasses filled, and \\( G_4 \\) be the number of 4-ounce glasses to be filled with the remaining water. \n\nClaudia has used \\( G_8 \\times 8 \\) ounces on 8-ounce glasses and \\( G_5 \\times 5 \\) ounces on 5-ounce glasses.

{"question": "Olaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?", "answer": "Let \\(N\\) represent the total number of men, \\(W\\) represent the amount of water needed per day per man, \\(D\\) represent the distance traveled per day, and \\(T\\) represent the total number of days of travel. The equation to find the total amount of water needed \\(G\\) is given by:\n\n\\[G = N \\times W \\times T\\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount of water needed (\\(G\\)) is the product of the number of men (\\(N\\)), the amount of water needed per day per man (\\(W\\)), and the total number of days of travel (\\(T\\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(N = 25\\) men (including Olaf)\n- \\(W = \\frac{1}{2}\\) gallon of water per day per man\n- \\(D = 200\\) miles per day\n- \\(D = 4000\\) miles (total distance of travel)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[G = 25 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times T\\]\n\nSince Olaf's boat can travel 200 miles per day, the number of days of travel (\\(T\\)) can be found by dividing the total distance of travel (\\(D\\)) by the distance traveled per day (\\(D\\)):\n\n\\[T = \\frac{D}{D}\\]\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation:\n\n\\[G = 25 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{D}{D}\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[G = 25 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1\\]\n\n\\[G = 25 \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\]\n\n\\[G = 12.5\\]\n\nTherefore, Olaf needs 12.5 gallons of water per day. It will take 20 days of travel, so he will need a total of 250 gallons of water. \n####\n250"}
