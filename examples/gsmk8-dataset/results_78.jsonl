{"question": "Chrystal\u2019s vehicle speed is 30 miles per hour. Ascending the mountain decreases its speed by fifty percent, and descending the mountain increases its speed by twenty percent. If the distance going to the top of the mountain is 60 miles and the distance going down to the foot of the mountain is 72 miles, how many hours will Crystal have to pass the whole mountain?", "answer": "Let \\(V\\) represent the vehicle's speed, \\(D_1\\) represent the distance going to the top of the mountain, and \\(D_2\\) represent the distance going down to the foot of the mountain. The time taken to ascend the mountain (\\(T_1\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[T_1 = \\frac{D_1}{V}\\]\n\nThe equation above states that the time taken to ascend the mountain (\\(T_1\\)) is equal to the distance traveled (\\(D_1\\)) divided by the vehicle's speed (\\(V\\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(V = 30\\) miles per hour (vehicle's speed)\n- \\(D_1 = 60\\) miles (distance to the top of the mountain)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[T_1 = \\frac{60}{30}\\]\n\\[T_1 = 2\\]\n\nTherefore, Chrystal will spend 2 hours to ascend the mountain.\n\nNext, the vehicle's speed increases to \\(V+V \\times 0.20\\) miles per hour when descending the mountain. The time taken to descend (\\(T_2\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[T_2 = \\frac{D_2}{V+V \\times 0.20}\\]\n\nThe equation above states that the time taken to descend the mountain (\\(T_2\\)) is equal to the distance traveled (\\(D_2\\)) divided by the vehicle's speed when descending (\\(V+V \\times 0.20\\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(D_2 = 72\\) miles (distance to the foot of the mountain)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[T_2 = \\frac{72}{30+30 \\times 0.20}\\]\n\\[T_2 = \\frac{72}{36}\\]\n\\[T_2 = 2\\]\n\nTherefore, Chrystal will spend 2 hours to descend the mountain.\n\nFinally, the total time (\\(T\\)) to pass the whole mountain is given by:\n\n\\[T = T_1 + T_2\\]\n\nThe equation above states that the total time (\\(T\\)) to pass the whole mountain is equal to the time taken to ascend (\\(T_1\\)) plus the time taken to descend (\\(T_2\\)).\n\nApplying the values of \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) to the equation:\n\n\\[T = 2 + 2\\]\n\\[T = 4\\]\n\nTherefore, Chrystal will spend a total of 4 hours to pass the whole mountain.\n####\n6"}
