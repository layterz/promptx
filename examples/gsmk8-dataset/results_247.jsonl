{"question": "The big fashion show is being planned for next week.  The show includes runway models strutting up and down the runway wearing designer clothing in front of an audience.  There are two parts to the show: evening wear and bathing suits.  It takes a model 2 minutes to walk out to the end of the runway and back, and models take turns, one at a time, walking the runway up and back, while wearing different clothes.  If there are 6 models in the show, and each model will wear two sets of bathing suits and three sets of evening wear clothing during the runway portion of the show, how long will it take, in minutes, to complete all of the runway trips during the show?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) represent the number of models in the fashion show, \\( S \\) represent the number of sets of bathing suits worn by each model, and \\( E \\) represent the number of sets of evening wear worn by each model. The total number of trips \\( T \\) up and down the runway during the show is given by:\n\n\\[ T = (M \\times S) + (M \\times E) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of trips up and down the runway is the sum of the number of trips wearing bathing suits (\\( M \\times S \\)) and the number of trips wearing evening wear (\\( M \\times E \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( M = 6 \\) models\n- \\( S = 2 \\) sets of bathing suits worn by each model\n- \\( E = 3 \\) sets of evening wear worn by each model\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = (6 \\times 2) + (6 \\times 3) \\]\n\\[ T = 12 + 18 \\]\n\\[ T = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, there will be a total of 30 trips up and down the runway during the fashion show.\n\nSince each trip takes 2 minutes, the total time to complete all trips is:\n\n\\[ \\text{{Total time}} = T \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Total time}} = 30 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Total time}} = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take 60 minutes to complete all of the runway trips during the fashion show.\n#### 60"}
{"question": "A reporter is paid by the word and per article. She earns $.1 per word. She earns $60 per article. She has to finish three stories in the next 4 hours. She averages 10 words a minute. How much can she expect to earn per hour if she writes the entire time?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) represent the number of words written, \\( A \\) represent the number of articles written, and \\( R \\) represent the total earnings. \n\nThe reporter earns $.1 per word, so the earnings from words is given by:\n\\[ E_W = 0.1 \\cdot W \\]\n\nThe reporter earns $60 per article, so the earnings from articles is given by:\n\\[ E_A = 60 \\cdot A \\]\n\nThe total earnings from writing is the sum of the earnings from words and articles:\n\\[ R = E_W + E_A \\]\n\nThe reporter has 4 hours to write, and she averages 10 words per minute, so the total time in minutes is given by:\n\\[ T = 4 \\cdot 60 \\]\n\nThe total number of words written is the product of the average words per minute and the total time in minutes:\n\\[ W = 10 \\cdot T \\]\n\nThe total number of articles written is given as 3.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 4 \\cdot 60 \\) minutes (total time in minutes)\n- \\( A = 3 \\) articles (total number of articles written)\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n\\[ W = 10 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 60) \\]\n\\[ W = 10 \\cdot 240 \\]\n\\[ W = 2400 \\]\n\n\\[ E_W = 0.1 \\cdot 2400 \\]\n\\[ E_W = 240 \\]\n\n\\[ E_A = 60 \\cdot 3 \\]\n\\[ E_A = 180 \\]\n\n\\[ R = 240 + 180 \\]\n\\[ R = 420 \\]\n\nTherefore, the reporter can expect to earn $420 in total.\n\nTo calculate the average earnings per hour, we divide the total earnings by the number of hours:\n\\[ \\text{{Average}} = \\frac{420}{4} \\]\n\nHence the reporters hourly pay will be $105."}
{"question": "Julie, Letitia and Anton decided to have dinner together at a nearby restaurant.  Julie orders $10 worth of food, Letitia orders $20 worth of food, and Anton orders $30 worth of food.
