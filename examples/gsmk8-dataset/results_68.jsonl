{"question": "Greg is riding his bike around town and notices that each block he rides, his wheels rotate 200 times. He's now on a a trail and wants to make sure he rides at least 8 blocks. His wheels have already rotated 600 times, how many more times do they need to rotate to reach his goal?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the number of blocks Greg wants to ride, and \\( R \\) represent the number of times his wheels need to rotate. The number of times his wheels need to rotate can be calculated by multiplying the number of blocks by the number of rotations per block.
