{"question": "Tony has two fish. Every year, his parents buy him two more, but one of them dies. How many fish will he have in five years?", "answer": "Let \\( F \\) represent the number of fish Tony has after a certain number of years, and \\( Y \\) represent the number of years. The equation to find the number of fish Tony will have in \\( Y \\) years is given by:\n\n\\[ F = 2 + (Y - 1) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of fish Tony will have in \\( Y \\) years (\\( F \\)) is equal to the initial number of fish Tony has (2) plus the difference in years (\\( Y - 1 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( Y = 5 \\) years\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ F = 2 + (5 - 1) \\]\n\\[ F = 2 + 4 \\]\n\\[ F = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tony will have 7 fish in 5 years.\n#### 7"}
{"question": "A pea patch is twice as big as a radish patch. If one sixth of the pea patch is 5 square feet.  How much is a whole radish patch in square feet?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) be the size of the pea patch and \\( R \\) be the size of the radish patch. \n\nIt is given that the pea patch is twice as big as the radish patch, so we can express this relationship as \\( P = 2R \\).\n\nAlso, it is given that one-sixth of the pea patch is 5 square feet. So, we can express this relationship as \\( \\frac{1}{6}P = 5 \\).\n\nTo find the size of the radish patch (\\( R \\)), we need to find the value of \\( R \\) that satisfies both equations. \n\nWe can rearrange the equation \\( P = 2R \\) to solve for \\( R \\) as \\( R = \\frac{1}{2}P \\).\n\nSubstituting this value of \\( R \\) in the second equation, we get \\( \\frac{1}{6}P = 5 \\).\n\nSolving for \\( P \\) in the second equation, we find \\( P = 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\) square feet.\n\nSubstituting this value of \\( P \\) in the first equation, we can find the value of \\( R \\):\n\n\\( R = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 30 = 15 \\) square feet.\n\nTherefore, the whole radish patch is 15 square feet. \n####\n15"}
