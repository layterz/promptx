{"question": "At a station, a train comes every 5 minutes leaving 200 passengers and taking 320 others. How many different passengers step on and off a train at the station within an hour?", "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of passengers that are exchanged during each train arrival and the number of train arrivals within an hour.\n\nLet \\( P_A \\) represent the number of passengers arriving and \\( P_D \\) represent the number of passengers departing during each train arrival. The total number of different passengers \\( P_T \\) stepping on and off the train at the station within an hour is given by:\n\n\\[ P_T = (P_A + P_D) \\times \\text{{number of train arrivals within an hour}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_A = 200 \\) passengers (number of arriving passengers during each train arrival)\n- \\( P_D = 320 \\) passengers (number of departing passengers during each train arrival)\n- One hour is equal to 60 minutes\n- A train arrives every 5 minutes\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_T = (200 + 320) \\times (60/5) \\]\n\\[ P_T = 520 \\times 12 \\]\n\\[ P_T = 6240 \\]\n\nTherefore, within an hour, 6240 different passengers step on and off the train at the station. \n####\n6240"}

The total number of books in the pyramid is given by:\n\n\\[ B_{\\text{total}} = B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4 \\]\n\nGiven that each level has 80% as many books as the previous level, we can express the number of books in each level as a percentage of the previous level. This can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\[ B_n = 0.8^{n-1} B_1 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) represents the level number.\n\nWe are given that the top level has 64 books, which corresponds to the fourth level (\\( n = 4 \\)). \n\nWe can use this information to find the number of books in the other levels:\n\n\\[ B_3 = \\frac{64}{0.8} = 80 \\]\n\\[ B_2 = \\frac{80}{0.8} = 100 \\]\n\\[ B_1 = \\frac{100}{0.8} = 125 \\]\n\nApplying these values to the equation for the total number of books:\n\n\\[ B_{\\text{total}} = 125 + 100 + 80 + 64 \\]\n\\[ B_{\\text{total}} = 369 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 369 books in the pyramid. \n####\n369"}

The combined age of the two brothers \\( S \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ S = A + T \\]\n\nSince we are looking for the number of years it will take for their combined age to be 44 years, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ S + Y = 44 \\]\n\nWhere \\( Y \\) represents the number of years. Rearranging the equation to solve for \\( Y \\), we get:\n\n\\[ Y = 44 - S \\]\n\nSince we already know their current combined age is 20 years, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n\\[ Y = 44 - 20 \\]\n\\[ Y = 24 \\]\n\nThis means that Adam and Tom need a total of 24 more years to be 44 years old together.\n\nSince each year increases the sum of their ages by 2 years (since there are two brothers), we can divide the total number of years by 2 to get the number of years it will take for their combined age to be 44 years:\n\n\\[ Y = \\frac{24}{2} \\]\n\\[ Y = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, both brothers will be 44 years old together after 12 years. \n####\n12"}
