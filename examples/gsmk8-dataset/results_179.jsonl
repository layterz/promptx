{"question": "A rival football team has won twice as many matches as the home team they will be playing did. If records show that the home team has won three matches, and each team drew four matches and lost none, how many matches have both teams played in total?", "answer": "Let \\(H\\) represent the number of matches won by the home team, \\(R\\) represent the number of matches won by the rival team, and \\(D\\) represent the number of matches drawn by both teams. \n\nGiven that the rival team won twice as many matches as the home team, we can express \\(R\\) in terms of \\(H\\) as \\(R = 2H\\). \n\nIt is also mentioned that each team drew 4 matches, so \\(D\\) can be expressed as \\(D = 2(4) = 8\\).\n\nThe total number of matches played can be found by adding the number of wins, draws, and losses for both teams. Since both teams did not lose any matches, the total number of matches played can be expressed as:\n\n\\[H + R + D = H + 2H + 8 = 3H + 8\\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(H = 3\\) (number of matches won by the home team)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[3H + 8 = 3(3) + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17\\]\n\nTherefore, both teams played a total of 17 matches. \n####\n17"}

{"question": "Luis is driving 80 miles in 2 hours. How far will he go in 15 minutes?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the distance Luis will go in 15 minutes. \n\nFirst, we need to find how far Luis drives in 1 minute. \n\nLuis drives 80 miles in 2 hours, so he drives 80/2 = 40 miles in 1 hour. \n\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then Luis drives 40/60 = 2/3 of a mile in 1 minute.\n\nSo in 15 minutes, he will go 2/3 x 15 = 10 miles.\n\nTherefore, Luis will go 10 miles in 15 minutes. \n#### 10"}
