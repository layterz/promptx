{"question": "Jenna is buying concert tickets for her group of five friends. She's able to get two of the tickets from the concert website for $50 each before they sell out. A scalper offers to sell her two more tickets for 240% of the normal price, but Jenna convinces him to give her $10 off that total payment. Finally, one of her friends gets a discounted ticket through her job for 60% of the normal price. How much do Jenna's friends pay for their tickets in total?", "answer": "Let \\( P_n \\) represent the normal price of a concert ticket, \\( Q_n \\) represent the quantity of tickets purchased at the normal price, and \\( P_d \\) represent the discounted price of a ticket. The total price \\( T \\) that Jenna's friends pay for their tickets can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n\\[ T = P_n \\cdot Q_n + (P_n \\cdot 2.4 - 10) + (P_n \\cdot 0.6) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total price (\\( T \\)) is the sum of the price of the tickets purchased at the normal price \\( P_n \\cdot Q_n \\), the price of the tickets purchased from the scalper at 240% of the normal price (\\( P_n \\cdot 2.4 \\)) minus the $10 discount negotiated by Jenna, and the price of the discounted ticket obtained through her friend's job (\\( P_n \\cdot 0.6 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_n = \\$50 \\) (normal price of a ticket)\n- \\( Q_n = 2 \\) (quantity of tickets purchased at the normal price)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\$50 \\cdot 2 + (\\$50 \\cdot 2.4 - 10) + (\\$50 \\cdot 0.6) \\]\n\\[ T = \\$100 + (\\$120 - \\$10) + (\\$30) \\]\n\\[ T = \\$100 + \\$110 + \\$30 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$360 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jenna's friends will pay a total of $360 for their concert tickets.####\n360"}
