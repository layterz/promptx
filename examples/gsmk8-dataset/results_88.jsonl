{"question": "Tim is 5 years old. His cousin, Rommel, is thrice as old as he is. His other cousin, Jenny, is 2 years older than Rommel. How many years younger is Tim than Jenny?", "answer": "To solve the general case, we need to assign variables to the given values in the question. \n\n- Let \\( T \\) represent Tim's age.\n- Let \\( R \\) represent Rommel's age.\n- Let \\( J \\) represent Jenny's age.\n\nWe can then write the following equations:\n\n1. Rommel is thrice as old as Tim: \\( R = 3T \\)\n2. Jenny is 2 years older than Rommel: \\( J = R + 2 \\)\n3. Tim is younger than Jenny by a certain number of years: \\( T = J - x \\)\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we substitute the values of \\( R \\) and \\( J \\) into equation 3:\n\n\\[ T = J - x \\]\n\\[ T = (R + 2) - x \\]\n\\[ T = (3T + 2) - x \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 3T + 2 - x \\]\n\\[ 0 = 2T + 2 - x \\]\n\\[ x = 2T + 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tim is \\( 2T + 2 \\) years younger than Jenny. ####\n\nTo find the specific answer for this example:\n\n- Tim is 5 years old, so \\( T = 5 \\)\n- Substituting the value of \\( T \\) into the equation, we have:\n\n\\[ x = 2(5) + 2 \\]\n\\[ x = 10 + 2 \\]\n\\[ x = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tim is 12 years younger than Jenny."}
