{"question": "Hanna has $300. She wants to buy roses at $2 each and give some of the roses to her friends, Jenna and Imma. Jenna will receive  1/3 of the roses, and  Imma will receive 1/2 of the roses. How many roses does Hanna give to her friends?", "answer": "Let \\( R \\) represent the total number of roses that Hanna gives to her friends, \\( R_J \\) represent the number of roses Jenna receives, and \\( R_I \\) represent the number of roses Imma receives. The equation to find the total number of roses \\( R \\) that Hanna gives to her friends is given by:\n\n\\[ R = R_J + R_I \\]\n\nSince Jenna receives 1/3 of the roses and Imma receives 1/2 of the roses, we can express \\( R_J \\) and \\( R_I \\) in terms of \\( R \\) as:\n\n\\[ R_J = \frac{1}{3} R \\]\n\\[ R_I = \frac{1}{2} R \\]\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ R = \frac{1}{3} R + \frac{1}{2} R \\]\n\\[ R = \frac{5}{6} R \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of roses \\( R \\) that Hanna gives to her friends is five-sixths of the total number of roses.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( R = 150 \\) roses (total number of roses that Hanna can buy)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ 150 = \frac{5}{6} \times 150 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( R \\), we get:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{6}{5} \times 150 \\]\n\\[ R = 180 \\]\n\nTherefore, Hanna gives a total of 180 roses to her friends. \n    ####\n    180"}

{"question": "Giorgio plans to make cookies for his class. There are 40 students and he plans to make 2 cookies per student. If 10% of his classmates want oatmeal raisin, then how many oatmeal raisin cookies will Giorgio make?", "answer": "The number of oatmeal raisin cookies that Giorgio will make is obtained by multiplying the number of students who want oatmeal raisin by the number of oatmeal raisin cookies per student.\n\nLet's represent:\n- \\( N_s \\) as the number of students.\n- \\( N_c \\) as the number of cookies per student.\n- \\( N_o \\) as the number of oatmeal raisin cookies.\n\nThe number of students who want oatmeal raisin cookies is \\( N_s \\) multiplied by the proportion of students who want oatmeal raisin, which is 10%, or 0.1.
