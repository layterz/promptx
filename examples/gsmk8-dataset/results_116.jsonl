{"question": "Pauline has a garden with vegetables. In it, Pauline has planted 3 kinds of tomatoes - 5 of each kind, 5 kinds of cucumbers - 4 of each kind, and 30 potatoes. In the whole garden, there are 10 rows with 15 spaces in each to plant any vegetable. How many more vegetables could Pauline plant in her garden?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of vegetables Pauline can plant in her garden, and \\( P \\) represent the number of vegetables Pauline has already planted. The equation to find the number of vegetables \\( V \\) that Pauline can still plant in her garden is given by:\n\n\\[ V = T - P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of vegetables \\( V \\) that Pauline can still plant is equal to the total number of vegetables \\( T \\) minus the number of vegetables \\( P \\) that she has already planted.\n\nGiven:\n- 3 kinds of tomatoes, with 5 of each kind (\\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\) tomatoes in total)\n- 5 kinds of cucumbers, with 4 of each kind (\\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\) cucumbers in total)\n- 30 potatoes\n\nThe total number of vegetables Pauline has planted is:\n\n\\[ P = 15 + 20 + 30 \\]\n\\[ P = 65 \\]\n\nThe whole garden can be filled up with 10 rows, each with 15 spaces to plant any vegetable. Therefore, the total number of vegetables that Pauline can plant is:\n\n\\[ T = 10 \\times 15 \\]\n\\[ T = 150 \\]\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ V = 150 - 65 \\]\n\\[ V = 85 \\]\n\nTherefore, Pauline can still plant 85 more vegetables in her garden.\n####\n85"}
{"question": "John took a test with 80 questions.  For the first 40 questions, she got 90% right.  For the next 40 questions, she gets 95% right.  How many total questions does she get right?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) be the total number of questions on the test, \\( R_1 \\) be the percentage of questions answered correctly for the first part of the test, and \\( R_2 \\) be the percentage of questions answered correctly for the second part of the test. The equation to find the total number of questions answered correctly \\( R_T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ R_T = R_1 \\times \\left(\\frac{T}{2}\\right) + R_2 \\times \\left(\\frac{T}{2}\\right) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of questions answered correctly (\\( R_T \\)) is the sum of the number of questions answered correctly for the first part (\\( R_1 \\times \\left(\\frac{T}{2}\\right) \\)) and the number of questions answered correctly for the second part (\\( R_2 \\times \\left(\\frac{T}{2}\\right) \\)). Since each part of the test has the same number of questions (\\( \\frac{T}{2} \\)), we multiply the percentages by \\( \\frac{T}{2} \\) to get the number of questions answered correctly for each part.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 80 \\) questions (total number of questions on the test)\n- \\( R_1 = 90\\% \\) (percentage of questions answered correctly for the first part)\n- \\( R_2 = 95\\% \\) (percentage of questions answered correctly for the second part)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ R_T = 90\\% \\times \\left(\\frac{80}{2}\\right) + 95\\% \\times \\left(\\frac{80}{2}\\right) \\]\n\\[ R_T = 90\\% \\times 40 + 95\\% \\times 40 \\]\n\\[ R_T = 36 + 38 \\]\n\\[ R_T = 74 \\]\n\nTherefore, John gets a total of 74 questions right on the test.\n####\n74"}
{"question": "Tony goes on 5 rollercoasters while he is at the park. The first went 50 miles per hour. The second went 62 miles per hour. The third when 73 miles per hour. The fourth when 70 miles per hour. His average speed during the day was 59 miles per hour. How fast was the fifth coaster?", "answer": "Let \\( C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5 \\) represent the speeds of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth coaster, respectively. The average speed of all five coasters is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{{C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 + C_5}}{5} \\]\n\nFrom the information provided, we know that the average speed is 59 miles per hour. Therefore, we can express this equation as:\n\n\\[ 59 = \\frac{{C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 + C_5}}{5} \\]\n\nWe also know that the speeds of the first four coasters are 50 miles per hour, 62 miles per hour, 73 miles per hour, and 70 miles per hour, respectively. So we can express the total speed of the first four coasters as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total speed of first four coasters} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 \\]\n\nWe can substitute these values into the equation to solve for the speed of the fifth coaster:\n\n\\[ 59 = \\frac{{C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 + C_5}}{5} \\]\n\\[ 59 \\times 5 = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 + C_5 \\]\n\\[ 295 = 50 + 62 + 73 + 70 + C_5 \\]\n\\[ 295 = 255 + C_5 \\]\n\\[ C_5 = 295 - 255 \\]\n\\[ C_5 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed of the fifth coaster is 40 miles per hour.\n####\n40"}
