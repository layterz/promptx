{"question": "Sarah is playing tic-tac-toe. She wins $1 for every game she wins, $0 for every game she ties, and she loses $2 for every game she loses. If she played 100 games where she tied 40 of them, and she lost $30, how many games did she win?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) represent the number of games won by Sarah, \\( T \\) represent the number of games tied by Sarah, and \\( L \\) represent the number of games lost by Sarah. \n\nWe know that Sarah played a total of 100 games, where she tied 40 of them and lost $30. \n\nWe can set up the following equations:\n\n\\( W + T + L = 100 \\)  -----(1)\n\\( T = 40 \\) ------(2)\n\\( 1(W) + 0(T) - 2(L) = -30 \\) ------(3)\n\nFrom equation (2), we know that \\( T = 40 \\). \n\nWe can substitute this value into equations (1) and (3):\n\n\\( W + 40 + L = 100 \\) -----(4)\n\\( W - 2L = -30 \\) -----(5)\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for \\( W \\) and \\( L \\) using these two equations.\n\nSubtract equation (5) from equation (4):\n\n\\( (W + 40 + L) - (W - 2L) = 100 - (-30) \\)\n\\( W + 40 + L - W + 2L = 100 + 30 \\)\n\\( 40 + 3L = 130 \\)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\( 3L = 130 - 40 \\)\n\\( 3L = 90 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n\\( L = \\frac{90}{3} \\)\n\n\\( L = 30 \\)\n\nTherefore, Sarah lost 30 games.\n\nTo find the number of games won, we can substitute the value of \\( L \\) into equation (4):\n\n\\( W + 40 + 30 = 100 \\)\n\\( W + 70 = 100 \\)\n\\( W = 100 - 70 \\)\n\\( W = 30 \\)\n\nTherefore, Sarah won 30 games.\n\n#### 30"}

{"question": "Ruby was going to order pizza for dinner.  Her son would only eat pepperoni pizza.  Her daughter would only eat sausage.  Ruby and her husband wanted black olive and mushroom pizza.  To make life easy, Ruby decided to order an entire pizza for each of her children and she would split one with her husband.  The pizza restaurant charged $10.00 per pizza and $1.00 per topping.  She also needed to add a $5.00 tip.  Including tip, how much would the pizza order cost?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the number of pizzas ordered, \\( T \\) represent the number of toppings, and \\( C \\) represent the total cost of the pizza order. The equation to find the total cost \\( C \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ C = 10P + T \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total cost (\\( C \\)) is equal to the cost per pizza (\\$10) multiplied by the number of pizzas (\\( P \\)), plus the cost per topping (\\$1) multiplied by the number of toppings (\\( T \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 3 \\) (number of pizzas ordered)\n- \\( T = 4 \\) (number of toppings)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C = 10 \\times 3 + 4 \\]\n\\[ C = 30 + 4 \\]\n\\[ C = 34 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the pizza order, including the $5 tip, is $39.####39."}
