{"question": "Chelsea made 4 batches of cupcakes for the bake sale. The cupcakes took 20 minutes to bake and 30 minutes to ice per batch. How long did it take Chelsea to make the cupcakes?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) be the number of batches of cupcakes Chelsea made, \\( T_b \\) be the time taken to bake one batch of cupcakes, and \\( T_i \\) be the time taken to ice one batch of cupcakes. The total time \\( T \\) taken to make the cupcakes is given by:\n\n\\[ T = B \\times T_b + B \\times T_i \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total time \\( T \\) is equal to the number of batches of cupcakes \\( B \\) multiplied by the time taken to bake one batch \\( T_b \\), plus the number of batches of cupcakes \\( B \\) multiplied by the time taken to ice one batch \\( T_i \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 4 \\) batches (number of batches of cupcakes)\n- \\( T_b = 20 \\) minutes (time taken to bake one batch)\n- \\( T_i = 30 \\) minutes (time taken to ice one batch)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 4 \\times 20 + 4 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ T = 80 + 120 \\]\n\\[ T = 200 \\]\n\nTherefore, it took Chelsea 200 minutes to make the cupcakes for the bake sale.\n####\n200"}
{"question": "Miriam currently has 30 marbles, but she used to have more. Miriam gave her brother 60 marbles, gave her sister twice that amount and gave her friend Savanna three times the amount she currently has. How many marbles did Miriam start with?", "answer": "Let \\( M_s \\) represent the number of marbles that Miriam started with, \\( M_b \\) represent the number of marbles given to her brother, \\( M_sis \\) represent the number of marbles given to her sister, and \\( M_f \\) represent the number of marbles given to her friend Savanna.\n\nGiven that Miriam currently has 30 marbles, we can deduce that she started with 30 marbles after giving her brother 60 marbles. Therefore, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ M_s = 30 + M_b \\]\n\nMiriam's sister received twice the number of marbles given to her brother, which means she received \\( 2M_b \\). Hence, the total number of marbles before giving any to her brother or sister is given by:\n\n\\[ M_s + M_sis = 30 + M_b + 2M_b \\]\n\nMiriam's friend Savanna received three times the amount that Miriam currently has, which is \\( 3 \\times 30 = 90 \\) marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles before giving any to her friend is:\n\n\\[ M_s + M_sis + M_f = 30 + M_b + 2M_b + 90 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ M_s + M_sis + M_f = 30 + 3M_b + 90 \\]\n\\[ M_s + M_sis + M_f = 120 + 3M_b \\]\n\nGiven the total number of marbles before giving any to her friend is 300, we can substitute the values into the equation:\n\n\\[ 300 = 120 + 3M_b \\]\n\nSolving for \\( M_b \\):\n\n\\[ 3M_b = 300 - 120 \\]\n\\[ 3M_b = 180 \\]\n\\[ M_b = \\frac{180}{3} \\]\n\\[ M_b = 60 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( M_b \\) back into the equation for \\( M_s \\):\n\n\\[ M_s = 30 + M_b \\]\n\\[ M_s = 30 + 60 \\]\n\\[ M_s = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, Miriam started with 90 marbles. \n#### 90"}

The equation to find the number of cotton candies \\( C_l \\) left after Cersei ate some is given by:\n\n\\[ C_l = C - C_b - C_c - C_e \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 50 \\) (initial number of cotton candies)\n- \\( C_b = 5 \\cdot 2 = 10 \\) (number of cotton candies given to the brother and sister)\n- \\( C_e = 12 \\) (number of cotton candies eaten)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_l = 50 - 10 - C_c - 12 \\]\n\nTo find the number of cotton candies given to the cousin (\\( C_c \\)), we need to subtract the remaining cotton candies (\\( C_l \\)) by the number of cotton candies left after giving to the brother and sister:\n\n\\[ C_l = 40 - C_c - 12 \\]\n\\[ C_c = 40 - C_l - 12 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( C_l = 30 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ C_c = 40 - 30 - 12 \\]\n\\[ C_c = 10 - 12 \\]\n\\[ C_c = -2 \\]\n\nThis gives us a negative value, which doesn't make sense in this context.
