{"question": "Beth bakes 4, 2 dozen batches of cookies in a week.  If these cookies are shared amongst 16 people equally, how many cookies does each person consume?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) represent the number of cookies each person consumes.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 4 \\) (number of batches of cookies)\n- \\( D = 2 \\) (number of dozen cookies per batch)\n- \\( C_d = 12 \\) (number of cookies in a dozen)\n- \\( P = 16 \\) (number of people)\n\nTo find the number of cookies each person consumes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of cookies baked:\n   \\( C_T = B \\times D \\)\n\n2. Calculate the total number of cookies:\n   \\( C = C_T \\times C_d \\)\n\n3.

{"question": "Hannah hangs a 2 foot by 4 foot painting on a 5 foot by 10 foot wall. What percentage of the wall is taken up by the painting?", "answer": "Let \\( A_p \\) represent the area of the painting and \\( A_w \\) represent the area of the wall. The percentage of the wall taken up by the painting can be found by dividing the area of the painting by the area of the wall and multiplying by 100%. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n\\[ \\text{{Percentage}} = \\frac{{A_p}}{{A_w}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A_p = 2 \\) feet by 4 feet (area of the painting)\n- \\( A_w = 5 \\) feet by 10 feet (area of the wall)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{{Percentage}} = \\frac{{2 \\, \\text{{feet}} \\times 4 \\, \\text{{feet}}}}{{5 \\, \\text{{feet}} \\times 10 \\, \\text{{feet}}}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Percentage}} = \\frac{{8 \\, \\text{{square feet}}}}{{50 \\, \\text{{square feet}}}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Percentage}} = \\frac{{8}}{{50}} \\times 100\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Percentage}} = 16\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the painting takes up 16% of the wall. \n####\n16"}

{"question": "Adonis is playing a prank on his dad by replacing his shampoo with hot sauce. Every day, after his dad showers, Adonis replaces the shampoo with 1/2 an ounce of hot sauce. He knows his dad uses 1 oz of shampoo a day from a new 10 oz bottle that no one else uses.
