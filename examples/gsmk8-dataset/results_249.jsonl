{"question": "Sally eats 2 sandwiches on Saturday and 1 sandwich on Sunday. If each sandwich uses 2 pieces of bread, how many pieces of bread does Sally eat across Saturday and Sunday?", "answer": "Let \\( S_S \\) represent the number of sandwiches Sally eats on Saturday, and \\( S_Sd \\) represent the number of sandwiches Sally eats on Sunday. The total number of sandwiches \\( S_T \\) eaten across Saturday and Sunday is given by:\n\n\\[ S_T = S_S + S_Sd \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S_S = 2 \\) sandwiches (sandwiches eaten on Saturday)\n- \\( S_Sd = 1 \\) sandwich (sandwich eaten on Sunday)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S_T = 2 + 1 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sally eats a total of 3 sandwiches across Saturday and Sunday.\n\nTo find the number of pieces of bread Sally eats, we multiply the total number of sandwiches by the number of pieces of bread each sandwich uses:\n\n\\[ B_T = S_T \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ B_T = 3 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ B_T = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sally eats a total of 6 pieces of bread across Saturday and Sunday.\n####\n6"}
