{"question": "Chad is hosting a BBQ on the hottest day of the year, where there will be a total of 15 people.  He will need 2 pounds of ice per person to account for the heat.  One pound bags of ice are sold for $3.00 for a pack of 10.  How much will he spend on ice?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) be the total number of people attending Chad's BBQ and \\( I \\) be the total amount of ice needed in pounds. The equation to calculate the total cost of ice \\( C \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{I}{10} \\times \\text{{cost per bag}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total cost of ice is equal to the number of bags of ice needed (\\( I/10 \\)) multiplied by the cost per bag.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 15 \\) people (total number of guests)\n- \\( I = 2 \\) pounds per person (amount of ice needed per person)\n- cost per bag = $3.00\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{30}{10} \\times \\$3.00 \\]\n\\[ C = 3 \\times \\$3.00 \\]\n\\[ C = \\$9.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Chad will spend $9.00 on ice for his BBQ. \n####\n9"}
