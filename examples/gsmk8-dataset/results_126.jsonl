{"question": "Jimmy has a collection of 5 action figures. Each figure is worth $15, except for one which is worth $20. He decided to sell his collection. To do it fast he decided to sell each of them for $5 less than their value. How much will Jimmy earn if he sells all the figures?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) represent the total number of action figures, \\( P \\) represent the original price of each action figure, and \\( S \\) represent the selling price of each action figure. The equation to find the total earnings \\( E \\) if Jimmy sells all the figures is given by:\n\n\\[ E = (N-1) \\times (P-S) + P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total earnings \\( E \\) is equal to the difference between the original price and the selling price, multiplied by the total number of action figures minus one, plus the original price of one action figure.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( N = 5 \\) action figures (total number of action figures)\n- \\( P = 15 \\) dollars (original price of each action figure)\n- \\( S = P - 5 = 10 \\) dollars (selling price of each action figure, which is 5 dollars less than the original price)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ E = (4) \\times (15-10) + 15 \\]\n\\[ E = (4) \\times (5) + 15 \\]\n\\[ E = 20 + 15 \\]\n\\[ E = 35 \\]\n\nTherefore, if Jimmy sells all the figures, he will earn 35 dollars.\n####\n35"}
