{"question": "A farmer gets 20 pounds of bacon on average from a pig. He sells each pound for $6 at the monthly farmer\u2019s market. This month\u2019s pig is a runt that grew to only half the size of the average pig. How many dollars will the farmer make from the pig\u2019s bacon?", "answer": "Let \\( P_A \\) represent the average size of a pig, \\( P_S \\) represent the size of the current pig, \\( B_A \\) represent the average amount of bacon produced by a pig, and \\( B_S \\) represent the amount of bacon produced by the current pig. The amount of money \\( M \\) the farmer will make from the pig's bacon is given by:\n\n\\[ M = B_S \\times 6 \\]\n\nSince the current pig is half the size of the average pig, we can express \\( P_S \\) in terms of \\( P_A \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2} P_A \\). Similarly, we can express \\( B_S \\) in terms of \\( B_A \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2} B_A \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{1}{2} B_A \\times 6 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount of money the farmer will make from the pig's bacon (\\( M \\)) is half the average amount of bacon produced by a pig (\\( B_A \\)) multiplied by $6.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B_A = 20 \\) pounds (average amount of bacon produced by a pig)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{1}{2} 20 \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ M = 10 \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ M = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer will make $60 from the pig's bacon. \n#### 60"}
