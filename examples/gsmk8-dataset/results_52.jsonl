{"question": "James decides to try and collect rare artifacts in the field.  He spends 6 months researching before going on a 2-year-long expedition for his first find.  The second artifact takes 3 times as long for the research and discovery.  How long did it take him to find both?", "answer": "Let \\( R \\) represent the number of years spent on research, \\( D_1 \\) represent the number of years spent on the first artifact, and \\( D_2 \\) represent the number of years spent on the second artifact. The total number of years \\( T \\) it took to find both artifacts is given by:\n\n\\[ T = R + D_1 + D_2 \\]\n\nWe are given that the research took 6 months, which is equivalent to \\( \\frac{6}{12} \\) years.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{6}{12} + D_1 + D_2 \\]\n\nWe are also given that it took 2 years for the first artifact. Thus, \\( D_1 = 2 \\) years.\n\nSubstituting the values, we have:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{6}{12} + 2 + D_2 \\]\n\nWe are further given that the second artifact takes 3 times as long as the research and discovery. Thus, \\( D_2 = 3 \\times \\frac{6}{12} \\) years.\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( D_2 \\), we have:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{6}{12} + 2 + 3 \\times \\frac{6}{12} \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we find:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{2} + 2 + \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1 + 4 + 3}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{8}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ T = 4 \\] years\n\nTherefore, it took James a total of 4 years to find both artifacts. \n####\n4"}
{"question": "Jonathan eats 2500 calories every day except for Saturday, when he consumes an extra 1000 calories.  He burns 3000 calories every day.
