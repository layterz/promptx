{"question": "Karen bakes 50 chocolate chip cookies. She keeps 10 for herself, and she gives 8 to her grandparents. If Karen wants to give everyone in her class cookies, and there are 16 people in her class, how many cookies will each person receive?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) be the total number of cookies that Karen bakes, \\( K \\) be the number of cookies Karen keeps for herself, and \\( G \\) be the number of cookies Karen gives to her grandparents. The equation to find the number of cookies \\( P \\) each person in her class will receive is given by:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{{C - K - G}}{{\\text{{number of people in her class}}}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of cookies each person will receive (\\( P \\)) is the remaining number of cookies after subtracting the cookies Karen keeps for herself (\\( K \\)) and the cookies she gives to her grandparents (\\( G \\)) from the total number of cookies she bakes (\\( C \\)), divided by the number of people in her class.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 50 \\) (total number of cookies Karen bakes)\n- \\( K = 10 \\) (number of cookies Karen keeps for herself)\n- \\( G = 8 \\) (number of cookies Karen gives to her grandparents)\n- Number of people in her class = 16\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{{50 - 10 - 8}}{{16}} \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{{32}}{{16}} \\]\n\\[ P = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, each person in Karen's class will receive 2 cookies.\n####\n2"}
