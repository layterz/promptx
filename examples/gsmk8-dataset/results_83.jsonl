{"question": "A dragon hoards jewels and gold in its cave. A jealous king snuck in and stole three prize jewels. The dragon burned him to a crisp and stole back its jewels, along with twice as many of the king\u2019s crown jewels from his crown that melted in the dragon\u2019s fire. The new jewels were a third of the number of jewels the dragon had owned before. How many jewels did the dragon own in the end?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent the number of jewels the dragon owned before the theft. After stealing the king's crown jewels, the dragon obtained twice as many of them, which can be expressed as \\( 2 \\times 3 \\) crown jewels. Therefore, the total number of crown jewels the dragon acquired is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\).\n\nIt is also given that the new jewels the dragon acquired were a third of the number of jewels it owned before the theft. Thus, the equation to find the number of jewels the dragon owned after the theft (\\( J' \\)) is:\n\n\\[ J' = J + 6 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of jewels the dragon owned in the end (\\( J' \\)) is the sum of the jewels it owned before the theft (\\( J \\)) and the crown jewels it acquired (\\( 6 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- The king's crown jewels stolen = \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n- The number of jewels the dragon owned before the theft is a third of the new jewels (\\( J = 6 \\times 3 \\))\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ J' = 18 + 6 \\]\n\\[ J' = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the dragon owned 24 jewels in the end.\n####\n24"}
{"question": "A total of 107 oranges are picked by Del and Juan. Del picked 23 on each of 2 days and Juan picked the rest. How many oranges did Juan pick?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the number of oranges picked by Del and \\( J \\) represent the number of oranges picked by Juan. The total number of oranges \\( T \\) picked by both Del and Juan is given by:\n\n\\[ T = D + J \\]\n\nDel picked 23 oranges on each of 2 days, so the number of oranges picked by Del \\( D \\) can be expressed as \\( 23 \\times 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = 23 \\times 2 + J \\]\n\\[ T = 46 + J \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of oranges picked by Del and Juan (\\( T \\)) is equal to 46 plus the number of oranges picked by Juan (\\( J \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 107 \\) oranges (total number of oranges picked by Del and Juan)\n- \\( D = 23 \\times 2 = 46 \\) oranges (number of oranges picked by Del)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 107 = 46 + J \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( J \\), we can solve for \\( J \\) by subtracting 46 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ J = 107 - 46 \\]\n\\[ J = 61 \\]\n\nTherefore, Juan picked 61 oranges.####\n61"}
{"question": "Wade has called into a rest stop and decides to get food for the road. He buys a sandwich to eat now, one for the road, and one for in the evening. He also buys 2 drinks. If the drinks cost $4 each and Wade spends a total of $26 then how much, in dollars, did the sandwiches each cost?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the cost of each drink, and \\( S \\) represent the cost of each sandwich. The equation to find the cost of each sandwich \\( S \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ S = \\dfrac{T - D}{3} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the cost of each sandwich (\\( S \\)) is the total spending (\\( T \\)) minus the spending on drinks (\\( D \\)), divided by the total number of sandwiches (3).\n\nGiven:\n- The drinks cost a total of $4 per drink (\\( D = 4 \\)) times 2 drinks (\\( D = 2 \\)), so \\( D = 8 \\).\n- Wade spends a total of $26 (\\( T = 26 \\)).\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S = \\dfrac{26 - 8}{3} \\]\n\\[ S = \\dfrac{18}{3} \\]\n\\[ S = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, each sandwich costs $6.\n####\n6"}
{"question": "A store gives a 10% discount for the amount of the sell that was over $1000.  John buys 7 items that each cost $200.  What does his order cost after the discount?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) represent the number of items John buys, \\( P \\) represent the price of each item, \\( A \\) represent the total amount of his order before the discount, and \\( D \\) represent the discount amount. The equation to find the cost of his order after the discount \\( C \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ A = N \\times P \\]\n\nSince John buys 7 items that each cost $200, we can express \\( A \\) as \\( 7 \\times 200 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ A = 7 \\times 200 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount of his order before the discount (\\( A \\)) is the product of the number of items purchased (\\( N \\)) and the price per item (\\( P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( N = 7 \\) items (number of items purchased)\n- \\( P = $200 \\) (price per item)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ A = 7 \\times 200 \\]\n\nHis order came out to \\( 7 \\times 200 = $1400 \\).\nSo there was \\( 1400 - $1000 = $400 \\) that qualified for the discount.\nSo his discount saved \\( $400 \\times 0.1 = $40 \\).\nSo his purchase came out to \\( 1400 - $40 = $1360 \\).\n####\n1360"}
