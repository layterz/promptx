{"question": "Voltaire and Leila are vloggers, Voltaire has an average of 50 viewers per day while Leila has twice the number of viewers Voltaire has. If they earn $0.50 per view, how much does Leila earn per week?", "answer": "Let \\( V_V \\) represent the number of viewers Voltaire has and \\( V_L \\) represent the number of viewers Leila has. The equation to find the amount Leila earns per week, \\( E_L \\), is given by:\n\n\\[ E_L = V_L \\cdot 0.50 \\cdot 7 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount Leila earns per week (\\( E_L \\)) is equal to the number of viewers she has (\\( V_L \\)) multiplied by the earnings per view (\\$0.50) and multiplied by the number of days in a week (7).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( V_V = 50 \\) viewers per day (average viewers Voltaire has)\n- \\( V_L = 2 \\cdot V_V = 100 \\) viewers per day (viewers Leila has, which is twice the viewers Voltaire has)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ E_L = 100 \\cdot 0.50 \\cdot 7 \\]\n\\[ E_L = 50 \\cdot 7 \\]\n\\[ E_L = 350 \\]\n\nTherefore, Leila earns $350 every week.\n####\n350"}
{"question": "Janet lives in a city built on a grid system.  She walks 3 blocks north, then seven times as many blocks west. Then she turns around and walks 8 blocks south and twice as many blocks east in the direction of her home. If Janet can walk 2 blocks/minute, how long will it take her to get home?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) represent the number of blocks Janet needs to walk north, \\( W \\) represent the number of blocks Janet needs to walk west, \\( S \\) represent the number of blocks Janet needs to walk south, \\( E \\) represent the number of blocks Janet needs to walk east, and \\( T \\) represent the time it takes her to get home.\n\nFrom the given information, we can determine the following relationships:\n1. Janet walks 3 blocks north, so \\( N = 3 \\).\n2. Janet walks 7 times as many blocks west as she walked north, so \\( W = 7N = 7 \\times 3 \\).\n3. Janet walks 8 blocks south, so \\( S = 8 \\).\n4. Janet walks twice as many blocks east as she walked south, so \\( E = 2S = 2 \\times 8 \\).\n\nTo find the number of blocks west of her starting point, we subtract the number of blocks she walked east from the number of blocks she walked west:\n\\( \\text{{Blocks West}} = W - E = 7 \\times 3 - 2 \\times 8 \\).\n\nTo find the number of blocks she needs to walk north and east, we add the number of blocks she needs to walk north to the number of blocks she needs to walk east:\n\\( \\text{{Total Blocks}} = N + \\text{{Blocks West}} = 3 + (7 \\times 3 - 2 \\times 8) \\).\n\nFinally, to find the time it takes her to get home, we divide the distance she needs to walk by her speed:\n\\( T = \\frac{{\\text{{Total Blocks}}}}{{\\text{{Speed}}}} = \\frac{{3 + (7 \\times 3 - 2 \\times 8)}}{{2}} \\).\n\nCalculating the values:\n\\( \\text{{Blocks West}} = 7 \\times 3 - 2 \\times 8 = 5 \\)\n\\( \\text{{Total Blocks}} = 3 + 5 = 8 \\)\n\\( T = \\frac{{8}}{{2}} = 4 \\)\n\nTherefore, it will take Janet 4 minutes to get home. \n#### 4"}
