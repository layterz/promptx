{"question": "Porter earns $8 per day and works 5 times a week. His manager is asking him to work an extra day that promises him an extra fifty percent on top of his daily rate. How much money will he earn after a month if he renders overtime every week?", "answer": "Let \\( E \\) be the amount of money Porter earns per day, \\( N \\) be the number of days he works in a week, and \\( OT \\) be the extra amount he earns when working overtime. The equation to find the total amount of money \\( TP \\) Porter will earn in a month, including overtime pay, is given by:\n\n\\[ TP = (E \\times N \\times 4) + (OT \\times 4) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total pay (\\( TP \\)) is the sum of the total earnings from regular work days ( \\( E \\times N \\times 4 \\)) and the total earnings from working overtime (\\( OT \\times 4 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( E = \\$8 \\) per day (Porter's daily earnings)\n- \\( N = 5 \\) days per week (number of days Porter works in a week)\n- \\( OT = \\$8 \\times \\frac{50}{100} = \\$4 \\) (extra amount earned when working overtime)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ TP = (\\$8 \\times 5 \\times 4) + (\\$4 \\times 4) \\]\n\\[ TP = \\$160 + \\$48 \\]\n\\[ TP = \\$208 \\]\n\nTherefore, Porter will earn a total of \\$208 in a month, including overtime pay.\n#### 208"}
{"question": "Howard is taking his kindergarten class to the museum on a school trip. He splits the class equally into 3 groups and then each of the groups goes through the museum one student at a time.

The equation to find the number of additional pens \\( A_w - J_w \\) that Alex has compared to Jane in a given week is given by:\n\n\\[ A_w - J_w \\]\n\nSince Alex's pen collection doubles each week, we can express \\( A_w \\) as \\( 2^{w-1} \\cdot A_1 \\), where \\( w \\) represents the week number.
