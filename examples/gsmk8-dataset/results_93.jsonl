{"question": "OpenAI runs a robotics competition that limits the weight of each robot. Each robot can be no more than twice the minimum weight and no less than 5 pounds heavier than the standard robot. The standard robot weighs 100 pounds. What is the maximum weight of a robot in the competition?", "answer": "Let \\( W_s \\) represent the weight of the standard robot and \\( W_r \\) represent the weight of the robot in the competition. \n\nThe weight of the standard robot is given as 100 pounds, so \\( W_s = 100 \\) pounds. \n\nBased on the given information, the weight of each robot must be no less than 5 pounds heavier than the standard robot. Therefore, the minimum weight of a robot is \\( W_s + 5 \\), which is 105 pounds in this case.\n\nThe weight of each robot must also be no more than twice the minimum weight. Therefore, the maximum weight of a robot is \\( 2 \\times (W_s + 5) \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W_s = 100 \\) pounds (weight of the standard robot)\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n\\( W_r = 2 \\times (100 + 5) \\)\n\\( W_r = 2 \\times 105 \\)\n\\( W_r = 210 \\)\n\nTherefore, the maximum weight of a robot in the competition is 210 pounds.\n####\n210"}
{"question": "Marcy had 22 sodas in her fridge for a party. Her friend Tina came over and gave her 12 plus two times the number of sodas Marcy had before. How many sodas will Marcy have for the party?", "answer": "Let's represent the number of sodas Marcy had before Tina came over as \\(S_b\\). \n\nAccording to the given information, Tina gave Marcy 12 plus two times the number of sodas Marcy had before. So, we can represent the number of sodas Tina gave as \\(2 \\times S_b + 12\\). \n\nTherefore, the total number of sodas Marcy will have for the party is the sum of the sodas Marcy had before and the sodas Tina gave, which can be represented as \\(S_b + (2 \\times S_b + 12)\\). \n\nSimplifying the equation: \n\\(S_b + (2 \\times S_b + 12)\\) = \\(3 \\times S_b + 12\\)\n\nGiven:\n- \\(S_b = 22\\) sodas (sodas Marcy had before Tina came over)\n\nSubstituting the value into the equation:\n\\(3 \\times 22 + 12\\)\n\nCalculating:\n\\(66 + 12\\) = \\(78\\)\n\nTherefore, Marcy will have a total of 78 sodas for the party. \n####\n78"}
