{"question": "Ursula went to the store and bought butter, bread, a package of cheese, and tea. The bread was 2 times cheaper than the butter, while the price of the butter was 80% of the price of cheese. Tea was the most expensive and cost twice the price of a package of cheese. If the tea cost $10, how much did Ursula pay for her purchases?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) be the price of the butter, \\( Br \\) be the price of the bread, \\( C \\) be the price of the cheese, and \\( T \\) be the price of the tea. The equation to calculate the total amount paid \\( P \\) by Ursula is given by:\n\n\\[ P = B + Br + C + T \\]\n\nFrom the information given, we can determine the following relationships:\n- \\( Br = 2 \\times B \\) (The price of the bread is 2 times cheaper than the butter)\n- \\( B = 0.80 \\times C \\) (The price of the butter is 80% of the price of the cheese)\n- \\( T = 2 \\times C \\) (The tea cost twice the price of a package of cheese)\n\nUsing these relationships, we can substitute the values in the equation:\n\n\\[ P = B + 2 \\times B + C + 2 \\times C \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ P = 4 \\times B + 3 \\times C \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = $10 \\) (The price of the tea)\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( C \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ P = 4 \\times B + 3 \\times (10/2) \\] \n\\[ P = 4 \\times B + 15 \\]\n\nWe can now solve for the value of \\( B \\) by substituting the value of \\( C \\) into the equation \\( B = 0.80 \\times C \\):\n\n\\[ B = 0.80 \\times (10/2) \\]\n\\[ B = 0.80 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ B = $4 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( B \\) into the equation for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ P = 4 \\times 4 + 15 \\]\n\\[ P = 16 + 15 \\]\n\\[ P = $21 \\]\n\nTherefore, Ursula paid a total of $21 for her purchases. \n#### 21"}

The equation to find the number of miles \\( M_d \\) Jackson is running each day at the end of this exercise program is given by:\n\n\\[ M_d = M_w + 3 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of miles \\( M_d \\) Jackson runs each day at the end of this exercise program is the number of additional miles \\( M_w \\) added to the 3 miles he initially ran.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( M_w = 4 \\) miles (additional miles after four weeks)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ M_d = 4 + 3 \\]\n\\[ M_d = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jackson is running 7 miles each day at the end of this exercise program.\n####\n7"}
{"question": "There are three times as many misses as hits in an MLB game. If the number of misses is 50, how many hits and misses are made in the game?", "answer": "Let \\( H \\) represent the number of hits and \\( M \\) represent the number of misses in the game. \n\nGiven that there are three times as many misses as hits, we can express this relationship as \\( M = 3H \\). \n\nWe are also given that the number of misses is 50, so we can substitute this value into the equation: \n\n\\( 50 = 3H \\)\n\nTo solve for the number of hits and misses in the game, we need to find the total number of hits and misses, \\( H+M \\). \n\nFrom the equation \\( M = 3H \\), we can substitute \\( M \\) with \\( 3H \\) to get: \n\n\\( H+3H = H(1+3) \\) \n\nSimplifying the expression: \n\n\\( 4H = 50 \\) \n\nDividing both sides by 4: \n\n\\( H = \\frac{50}{4} \\)\n\n\\( H = 12.5 \\)\n\nSince hitting a fraction of a ball is not possible, we can round \\( H \\) to the nearest whole number.\n\nTherefore, the number of hits in the game is 13 and the number of misses is 3 times that, or 39.\n\nThus, the total number of hits and misses in the game is 13 + 39 = 52.\n\n#### 52"}
