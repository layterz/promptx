{"question": "John paints a giant mural that is 6m by 3m. The paint costs $4 per square meter. The artist can paint 1.5 square meters per hour and charges $10 per hour. How much does the mural cost?", "answer": "Let \\( A \\) represent the area of the mural in square meters, \\( P \\) represent the cost of the paint per square meter, \\( H \\) represent the number of hours the artist works, and \\( C \\) represent the cost charged by the artist per hour. The equation to calculate the total cost of the mural, \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = (A \\cdot P) + (H \\cdot C) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total cost of the mural (\\( T \\)) is the product of the area (\\( A \\)) and the cost of the paint per square meter (\\( P \\)) added to the product of the number of hours worked (\\( H \\)) and the cost charged by the artist per hour (\\( C \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A = 6 \\cdot 3 = 18 \\) square meters (area of the mural)\n- \\( P = $4 \\) per square meter (cost of paint)\n- \\( H = \\frac{A}{1.5} = 12 \\) hours (number of hours worked)\n- \\( C = $10 \\) per hour (cost charged by the artist)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = (18 \\cdot 4) + (12 \\cdot 10) \\]\n\\[ T = 72 + 120 \\]\n\\[ T = $192 \\]\n\nTherefore, the mural costs $192 in total.\n####\n192"}
{"question": "Tino has 24 more jellybeans than Lee. Arnold has half as many jellybeans as Lee. If Arnold has 5 jellybeans, how many jellybeans does Tino have?", "answer": "Let \\( L \\) represent the number of jellybeans Lee has, \\( A \\) represent the number of jellybeans Arnold has, and \\( T \\) represent the number of jellybeans Tino has. \n\nFrom the information given, we know that:\n- Arnold has half as many jellybeans as Lee, so \\( A = \\frac{1}{2} L \\).\n- Arnold has 5 jellybeans, so \\( A = 5 \\).\n- Tino has 24 more jellybeans than Lee, so \\( T = L + 24 \\).\n\nSo we can rewrite the equations as:\n\\( A = \\frac{1}{2} L \\)\n\\( A = 5 \\)\n\\( T = L + 24 \\)\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( A \\) into the first equation, we get:\n\\( \\frac{1}{2} L = 5 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( L \\):\n\\( L = 5 \\times 2 \\)\n\\( L = 10 \\)\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( L \\) into the third equation, we get:\n\\( T = 10 + 24 \\)\n\\( T = 34 \\)\n\nTherefore, Tino has 34 jellybeans. ####\n34"}
{"question": "Melinda is taking a 1200-mile trip with her family to visit their cousins.
