{"question": "Tracy feeds each of her two dogs 1.5 cups of food per meal. She feeds her dogs thrice a day. How many pounds of food do her two dogs consume if 1 pound is equal to 2.25 cups?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the number of cups of food consumed by each dog per meal, \\( M \\) represent the number of meals per day, and \\( P \\) represent the number of pounds of food consumed by both dogs.\n\nThe equation to find the number of pounds of food consumed by both dogs is given by:\n\n\\[ P = \\left( C \\times M \\times 2 \right) \u0014\\times \\frac{1}{2.25} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of pounds of food consumed (\\( P \\)) is equal to the number of cups of food consumed per meal (\\( C \\)) multiplied by the number of meals per day (\\( M \\)), then multiplied by 2 to account for both dogs. Finally, divide the result by the conversion factor of 2.25 to convert cups to pounds.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 1.5 \\) cups (food consumed per meal by each dog)\n- \\( M = 3 \\) meals (number of meals per day)\n- Conversion factor: 1 pound = 2.25 cups\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P = \\left( 1.5 \\times 3 \\times 2 \right) \u0014\\times \\frac{1}{2.25} \\]\n\\[ P = \\left( 4.5 \\times 2 \right) \u0014\\times \\frac{1}{2.25} \\]\n\\[ P = 9 \\times \\frac{1}{2.25} \\]\n\\[ P = 9 \\times \t\\frac{4}{9} \\]\n\\[ P = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tracy's two dogs consume 4 pounds of food.####\n4"}
{"question": "Mark is baking bread. He has to let it rise for 120 minutes twice. He also needs to spend 10 minutes kneading it and 30 minutes baking it. How many minutes does it take Mark to finish making the bread?", "answer": "Let's break down the steps to solve this problem using algebraic notation.\n\nLet \\( T_R \\) represent the total rise time, \\( T_K \\) represent the kneading time, and \\( T_B \\) represent the baking time. The equation to find the total time \\( T \\) it takes Mark to finish making bread is given by:\n\n\\[ T = T_R + T_K + T_B \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T_R = 120 \\) minutes (total rise time)\n- \\( T_K = 10 \\) minutes (kneading time)\n- \\( T_B = 30 \\) minutes (baking time)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 120 + 10 + 30 \\]\n\\[ T = 160 + 30 \\]\n\\[ T = 190 \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Mark 190 minutes to finish making the bread.\n####\n190"}
{"question": "James has 3 fish tanks.  1 of the tanks has 20 fish in it and the other two have twice as many fish each as the first. How many total fish do they have?", "answer": "Let \\( T_1 \\) represent the number of fish in the first tank, \\( T_2 \\) represent the number of fish in the second tank, and \\( T_3 \\) represent the number of fish in the third tank.
