{"question": "Jorge has an equal number of baseball cards as Matias, who has 6 fewer cards than Carlos. If Carlos has 20 baseball cards, what is the total number of baseball cards the three have?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent the number of baseball cards Jorge has, \\( M \\) represent the number of baseball cards Matias has, and \\( C \\) represent the number of baseball cards Carlos has. The total number of baseball cards \\( T \\) that the three have is given by:\n\n\\[ T = J + M + C \\]\n\nSince Matias has 6 fewer cards than Carlos, we can express \\( M \\) as \\( C - 6 \\).
