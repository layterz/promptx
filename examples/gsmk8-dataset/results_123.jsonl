{"question": "Piazzanos Pizzeria has a buy-1-get-1-free special on triple cheese pizzas, and a buy-2-get-1-free special on meat lovers pizzas.  If the standard price for a pizza is $5, how much does it cost, in dollars, to purchase 10 triple cheese and 9 meat lovers pizzas using the special pricing?", "answer": "Let \\( P_T \\) represent the total cost of purchasing 10 triple cheese and 9 meat lovers pizzas. \n\nUsing the buy-1-get-1-free pricing, it costs $5 to buy 2 triple cheese pizzas. Therefore, the cost per triple cheese pizza is $5/2.\n\nUsing the buy-2-get-1-free pricing, it costs $10 to buy 3 meat lovers pizzas. Therefore, the cost per meat lovers pizza is $10/3.\n\nWith the buy-1-get-1-free pricing, 10 triple cheese pizzas would cost \\( 10 \\times \\frac{5}{2} \\) dollars.\n\nWith the buy-2-get-1-free pricing, 9 meat lovers pizzas would cost \\( 9 \\times \\left(3 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, the total cost for 10 triple cheese and 9 meat lovers pizzas would be \\( 10 \\times \\frac{5}{2} + 9 \\times \\left(3 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\) dollars.\n\nCalculating the values:\n\n\\( P_T = 10 \\times \\frac{5}{2} + 9 \\times \\left(3 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\( P_T = 25 + 9 \\times \\left(3 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\)\n\n\\( P_T = 25 + 9 \\times 3 + 9 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\n\\( P_T = 25 + 27 + 3 \\)\n\n\\( P_T = 55 \\)\n\nTherefore, it will cost $55 to purchase 10 triple cheese and 9 meat lovers pizzas using the special pricing.\n####\n55"}
