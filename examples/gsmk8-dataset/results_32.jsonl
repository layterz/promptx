{"question": "A school choir needs robes for each of its 30 singers. Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) represent the number of robes the school needs to buy, and \\( P \\) represent the price of each robe.\n\nThe total amount the school will spend, \\( S \\), is given by:\n\n\\[ S = N \\times P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total spending (\\( S \\)) is equal to the number of robes to be bought (\\( N \\)) multiplied by the price of each robe (\\( P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( N = 30 - 12 = 18 \\) robes (robes the school needs to buy)\n- \\( P = $2 \\) (price of each robe)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 18 \\times $2 \\]\n\\[ S = $36 \\]\n\nTherefore, the school will spend $36 to purchase the remaining robes.\n####\n36"}
