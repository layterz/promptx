{"question": "A psychologist believes one in every four people has a disorder he calls ZYX syndrome. The clinic where he works has recently doubled its previous number of 26 patients. How many patients is the psychologist likely to diagnose with ZYX syndrome?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the total number of patients in the clinic and \\( P_Z \\) represent the number of patients diagnosed with ZYX syndrome. The number of patients diagnosed with ZYX syndrome can be calculated by:\n\n\\[ P_Z = \frac{1}{4} P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of patients diagnosed with ZYX syndrome (\\( P_Z \\)) is one-fourth of the total number of patients in the clinic (\\( P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 26 \\times 2 = 52 \\) patients (total number of patients in the clinic, which is double the previous number of patients)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_Z = \frac{1}{4} \\times 52 \\]\n\\[ P_Z = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, the psychologist is likely to diagnose 13 patients with ZYX syndrome. \n####\n13"}

The equation to find the number of firecrackers \\( S \\) set off by Jerry is given by:\n\n\\[ S = \frac{1}{2} G \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of firecrackers set off by Jerry (\\( S \\)) is half the number of good firecrackers (\\( G \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( F = 48 \\) firecrackers (original number of firecrackers)\n- \\( C = 12 \\) firecrackers (number of confiscated firecrackers)\n- \frac{1}{6} of the remaining firecrackers are defective.\n\nTo find the number of good firecrackers, we need to subtract the confiscated and defective firecrackers from the original number. First, subtract the confiscated firecrackers from the original number:\n\n\\[ F - C = 48 - 12 = 36 \\]\n\nThen, multiply this number by \frac{1}{6} to find how many were defective:\n\n\\[ \frac{1}{6} (F-C) \\]\n\n\\[ \frac{1}{6} (36) = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( D = 6 \\) firecrackers (number of defective firecrackers).\n\nTo find the number of good firecrackers, subtract the defective firecrackers from the remaining firecrackers:\n\n\\[ G = (F - C) - D \\]\n\n\\[ G = 36 - 6 = 30 \\]\n\nNow, apply the value of \\( G \\) to the equation to find the number of firecrackers Jerry set off:\n\n\\[ S = \frac{1}{2} G \\]\n\n\\[ S = \frac{1}{2} (30) = 15 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jerry set off 15 firecrackers. ####\n15"}
