{"question": "Last month, a factory made 12000 dolls and their associated accessories.  The accessories for each doll included 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats.  If each doll took 45 seconds to make and each accessory took 10 seconds to make, what was the total combined machine operation time, in seconds, required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the number of dolls made by the factory, \\( S \\) represent the number of shoes made, \\( B \\) represent the number of bags made, \\( C \\) represent the number of cosmetics sets made, and \\( H \\) represent the number of hats made. The total number of accessories made is given by:\n\n\\[ A = S + B + C + H \\]\n\nThe number of shoes made is \\( D \\) dolls multiplied by 2 shoes per doll, so \\( S = 2D \\). Similarly, the number of bags made is \\( D \\) dolls multiplied by 3 bags per doll, so \\( B = 3D \\). The number of cosmetics sets made for each doll is just one, so \\( C = D \\). Finally, the number of hats made is \\( D \\) dolls multiplied by 5 hats per doll, so \\( H = 5D \\). Substituting these values into the equation for \\( A \\):\n\n\\[ A = 2D + 3D + D + 5D \\]\n\\[ A = 11D \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of accessories made (\\( A \\)) is 11 times the number of dolls made (\\( D \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D = 12000 \\) dolls (number of dolls made)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ A = 11 times 12000 \\]\n\\[ A = 132000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of accessories made is 132000.\n\nThe dolls took \\( 12000 \\) dolls multiplied by 45 seconds per doll to be made, so the total time for making the dolls is \\( 12000 \\times 45 = 540000 \\) seconds.\n\nAll the accessories took \\( 132000 \\) accessories multiplied by 10 seconds per accessory to be made, so the total time for making the accessories is \\( 132000 \\times 10 = 1320000 \\) seconds.\n\nCombining both results, the total time the machinery was working is \\( 540000 + 1320000 = 1860000 \\) seconds.\n\nTherefore, the total combined machine operation time required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories is 1860000 seconds.####\n1860000"}
{"question": "A monkey swings from branch to branch at an average distance of 1.2 meters per second. How far will a monkey swing in meters if it consistently swings from branches for 30 minutes?", "answer": "Let \\(D\\) represent the distance a monkey can swing in meters, \\(R\\) represent the rate of swinging in meters per second, and \\(T\\) represent the time in seconds. The equation to find the distance \\(D\\) a monkey will swing in \\(T\\) seconds is given by:\n\n\\[D = R \\times T\\]\n\nThis equation states that the distance \\(D\\) is equal to the rate of swinging \\(R\\) multiplied by the time \\(T\\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(R = 1.2\\) meters per second (average rate of swinging)\n- \\(T = 30\\) minutes (time in minutes)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\[D = 1.2 \\times 30 \\times 60\\]\n\nConverting 30 minutes to seconds:\n\\[D = 1.2 \\times 1800\\]\n\\[D = 2160\\]\n\nTherefore, a monkey will swing a distance of 2160 meters in 30 minutes.\n####\n2160"}
{"question": "Lucca has 100 balls and 10 percent of his balls are basketballs. Lucien has 200 balls and 20 percent of them are basketballs.

{"question": "A group of researchers are studying a colony of penguins. Their results show that the size doubled in the first year they watched the colony, then tripled in the next year. This year, however, harsh conditions meant the colony only gained 129 penguins. The colony has 1077 penguins in it now. Each penguin eats one and a half fish every day. How many fish did the whole colony catch per day to eat at the beginning of the first year?", "answer": "Let \\( P_0 \\) represent the number of penguins at the beginning of the first year, and \\( P_1 \\) represent the number of penguins at the beginning of the second year. The number of penguins at the beginning of this year \\( P_2 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 + 129 \\]\n\nSince the size of the colony doubled in the first year, we can express \\( P_1 \\) as \\( 2P_0 \\).
