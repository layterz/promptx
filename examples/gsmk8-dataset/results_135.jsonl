{"question": "Alfred likes to save $1,000.00 over 12 months for his Christmas shopping.  He has $100.00 left over from last year's holiday to put towards this year's goal.  How much money does Alfred now need to save each month in order to reach his goal in 12 months?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) be the total amount of money Alfred wants to save for the Christmas shopping, \\( L \\) be the amount of money left over from last year, and \\( M \\) be the monthly amount Alfred needs to save.\n\nThe equation to find the monthly amount \\( M \\) Alfred needs to save in order to reach his goal in 12 months is given by:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{S - L}{12} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the monthly amount \\( M \\) is obtained by dividing the remaining amount to be saved (\\( S - L \\)) by the number of months (\\( 12 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = \\$1,000.00 \\) (total amount Alfred wants to save)\n- \\( L = \\$100.00 \\) (amount left over from last year)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{\\$1,000.00 - \\$100.00}{12} \\]\n\\[ M = \\frac{\\$900.00}{12} \\]\n\\[ M = \\$75.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Alfred needs to save \\$75.00 per month in order to reach his goal of \\$1,000.00 in 12 months.\n####\n75"}
{"question": "Victoria had $500. She went to the market and bought 2 packets of rice each at $20, 3 packets of wheat flour each at $25, and 1 soda at $150. What was her remaining balance?", "answer": "Let's define some variables:\n- \\( R \\) represents Victoria's remaining balance after purchasing groceries\n- \\( P_R \\) represents the total amount spent on rice\n- \\( P_W \\) represents the total amount spent on wheat flour\n- \\( P_S \\) represents the amount spent on soda\n\nWe can express the total amount spent on rice as \\( P_R = 2 \\times 20 \\) since she bought 2 packets of rice at $20 each.\nSimilarly, the total amount spent on wheat flour can be expressed as \\( P_W = 3 \\times 25 \\) since she bought 3 packets of wheat flour at $25 each.\nThe amount spent on soda is \\( P_S = 150 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total amount spent on groceries is:\n\\[ P_T = P_R + P_W + P_S \\]\n\\[ P_T = 2 \\times 20 + 3 \\times 25 + 150 \\]\n\\[ P_T = 265 \\]\n\nTo calculate Victoria's remaining balance, we subtract the total amount spent on groceries from her initial balance of $500:\n\\[ R = 500 - P_T \\]\n\\[ R = 500 - 265 \\]\n\\[ R = 235 \\]\n\nTherefore, Victoria's remaining balance is $235.\n####\n235"}
{"question": "Roy spends 2 hours on sports activities in school every day. He goes to school 5 days a week. If he missed 2 days within a week, how many hours did he spend on sports in school that week?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the total number of days in a week, and \\( H \\) represent the number of hours spent on sports activities in school each day. The total number of hours spent on sports activities in school within a week is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ H_T = D \\times H \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of hours spent on sports activities in school (\\( H_T \\)) is equal to the number of days in the week (\\( D \\)) multiplied by the number of hours spent each day (\\( H \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D = 5 \\) days (number of days in a week)\n- \\( H = 2 \\) hours (number of hours spent on sports activities in school each day)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ H_T = 5 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ H_T = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Roy spent a total of 10 hours on sports activities in school that week.\n#### 10"}
{"question": "James has to refuel his plane.  It used to cost $200 to refill the tank.  He got an extra tank to double fuel capacity.  Fuel prices also went up by 20%.
