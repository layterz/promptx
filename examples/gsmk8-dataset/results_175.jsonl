Let \\( W \\) represent the time he spent on the warm-up puzzle, and \\( L \\) represent the time he spent on each of the long puzzles. \n\nWe are given that the warm-up puzzle took 10 minutes and each long puzzle took 3 times as long.

Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = W + 2L \\]\n\\[ T = W + 2(3W) \\]\n\\[ T = W + 6W \\]\n\\[ T = 7W \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total time spent solving puzzles (\\( T \\)) is 7 times the time spent on the warm-up puzzle (\\( W \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W = 10 \\) minutes (time spent on the warm-up puzzle)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 7 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ T = 70 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tony spent a total of 70 minutes solving puzzles.\n####\n70"}
{"question": "Jordan is a hockey goalie. In the first period of a game, he blocked four shots. In the second period, he blocked twice as many shots. In the third period, he blocked three fewer than in the second period. When the game ended after the fourth period, he had blocked 21 shots in all. How many did Jordan block in the fourth period?", "answer": "Let F be the number of shots Jordan blocked in the fourth period.\n\nIn the second period, he blocked 2 * 4 = 8 shots.\n\nIn the third period, he blocked 8 - 3 = 5 shots.\n\nIn the whole game, he blocked 4 + 8 + 5 + F = 17 + F = 21 shots.\n\nThus, Jordan blocked F = 21 - 17 = 4 shots in the fourth period.\n\n#### 4"}
{"question": "Thomas has been saving $40 in the bank every month for six years. His friend Joseph has been saving 2/5 times less money per month. How much money are they having in their savings account altogether?", "answer": "Let's represent the amount of money that Thomas has been saving per month as T and the amount of money that Joseph has been saving per month as J.\n\nGiven:\n- T = $40 (Thomas's monthly savings)\n- J = 2/5 * T (Joseph's monthly savings, which is 2/5 times less than Thomas's savings)\n\nWe know that Thomas has been saving for six years, and since each year has 12 months, he has been making savings for 6 * 12 = 72 months. Therefore, the total amount of money that Thomas has saved is 72 * $40 = $2880.\n\nTo find Joseph's savings, we need to calculate the amount he has been saving per month. Since Joseph's savings are 2/5 times less than Thomas's, we can subtract 2/5 * $40 from $40:\nJ = $40 - 2/5 * $40 = $24\n\nTherefore, Joseph has been saving $24 per month. In six years, he has saved $24 * 72 = $1728.\n\nTogether, Thomas and Joseph have saved a total of $2880 + $1728 = $4608.\n\nHence, they have a total of $4608 in their savings account. \n####\n4608"}
