{"question": "Sherry is making banana bread for a bake sale. She wants to make 99 loaves. Her recipe makes enough batter for 3 loaves. The recipe calls for 1 banana. How many bananas does Sherry need?", "answer": "Let N represent the number of bananas that Sherry needs. The number of bananas needed is equal to the number of batches of banana bread multiplied by the number of bananas per batch. Therefore, we can express this as:\n\nN = (Number of batches) x (Number of bananas per batch)\n\nGiven:\n- Sherry wants to make 99 loaves of banana bread.\n- The recipe makes enough batter for 3 loaves.\n- The recipe calls for 1 banana.\n\nTo find the number of batches, we can divide the total number of loaves by the number of loaves per batch:\n\n(Number of batches) = (Total number of loaves) / (Number of loaves per batch)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n(Number of batches) = 99 / 3\n(Number of batches) = 33\n\nTherefore, Sherry needs to make 33 batches of banana bread to make enough loaves.\n\nSince each batch calls for 1 banana, the number of bananas needed is equal to the number of batches:\n\nN = 33\n\nTherefore, Sherry needs 33 bananas to make enough banana bread.####\n33"}
{"question": "Two months ago, Wilson had a total of $150 in his bank account. Then last month, he deposited $17. A few days after, he made a withdrawal. This month, he deposited $21 so he has $16 more than what is in his account two months ago. How much did Wilson withdraw last month?", "answer": "Let \\(A_{-2}\\) represent the amount of money in Wilson's account two months ago, \\(A_{-1}\\) represent the amount of money in Wilson's account last month, and \\(A_0\\) represent the amount of money in Wilson's account this month. \n\nBased on the given information, we can write the following equations:\n\n1. \\(A_{-2} = \\$150\\)\n2. \\(A_{-1} = A_{-2} + \\$17\\)\n3. \\(A_0 = A_{-2} + \\$16\\)\n4. \\(A_{-1} = A_0 - \\$21\\)\n\nWe can solve for \\(A_{-1}\\) by substituting equations 1 and 3 into equation 4:\n\n\\((A_{-2} + \\$17) = (A_{-2} + \\$16) - \\$21\\)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\(\\$17 = -\\$5\\)\n\nThis equation is not possible, which means the problem is not solvable given the information provided.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine how much Wilson withdrew last month."}
{"question": "Thomas buys a weight vest.  It weighed 60 pounds and worked well for him in the beginning but after a bit of training he decides he wants to increase the weight by 60%.  The weights come in 2-pound steel ingots.  Each ingot cost $5 and if you buy more than 10 you get a 20% discount.  How much does it cost to get the weight he needs?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) be the weight of the weight vest in pounds, \\( P \\) be the price of each weight plate in dollars, and \\( N \\) be the number of weight plates needed. The equation to find the cost \\( C \\) to get the weight he needs is given by:\n\n\\[ C = P \\times N \\]\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the weight he needs to buy, which is 60% of the initial weight:\n\n\\[ W_n = 60\\% \\times W \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of weight plates needed. Since each weight plate weighs 2 pounds:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{W_n}{2} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost by multiplying the number of weight plates needed by the price of each weight plate. If the number of weight plates is more than 10, there is a 20% discount applied:\n\n\\[ C = P \\times N \\]\n\\[ C = P \\times \\left(N - 0.2N\\right) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W = 60 \\) pounds (initial weight of the weight vest)\n- \\( P = 5 \\) dollars (price of each weight plate)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ W_n = 60 \\times 0.6 \\]\n\\[ W_n = 36 \\]\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{36}{2} \\]\n\\[ N = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ C = 5 \\times \\left(18 - 0.2 \\times 18\\right) \\]\n\\[ C = 5 \\times 18 \\times 0.8 \\]\n\\[ C = 72 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost to get the weight he needs is $72.####\n72"}
