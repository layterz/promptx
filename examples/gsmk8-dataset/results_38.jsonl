{"question": "Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be three times as much in another three years. How much money will the art piece have increased by?", "answer": "Let \\( P_0 \\) represent the initial price of the art piece, and \\( P_f \\) represent the price of the art piece after three years. The increase in price \\( \\Delta P \\) can be found by subtracting the initial price from the final price:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = P_f - P_0 \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_0 = \\$4000 \\) (initial price of the art piece)\n- \\( P_f = 3 \\times P_0 = \\$12000 \\) (price of the art piece after three years, which is three times the initial price)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\$12000 - \\$4000 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta P = \\$8000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the art piece will increase by $8000.####\n8000"}
{"question": "The bald eagle can dive at a speed of 100 miles per hour, while the peregrine falcon can dive at a speed of twice that of the bald eagle.   Starting from the same treetop, if it takes the bald eagle 30 seconds to dive to the ground, how long,  in seconds, will it take the peregrine falcon to dive the same distance?", "answer": "Let \\( S_{BE} \\) represent the speed of the bald eagle in miles per hour, \\( S_{PF} \\) represent the speed of the peregrine falcon in miles per hour, \\( T_{BE} \\) represent the time it takes for the bald eagle to dive to the ground in seconds, and \\( T_{PF} \\) represent the time it takes for the peregrine falcon to dive the same distance in seconds.\n\nGiven that the bald eagle can dive at a speed of 100 miles per hour and it takes 30 seconds for the bald eagle to dive to the ground, we can find the speed of the peregrine falcon by multiplying the speed of the bald eagle by 2:\n\n\\( S_{PF} = 2 \\times S_{BE} \\)\n\n\\( S_{PF} = 2 \\times 100 \\)\n\n\\( S_{PF} = 200 \\) miles per hour\n\nNow, we want to find the time it takes for the peregrine falcon to dive the same distance as the bald eagle. We can set up the following equation based on the ratio of their speeds:\n\n\\( T_{PF} = T_{BE} \\times \\left( \\frac{S_{BE}}{S_{PF}} \\right) \\)\n\nGiven that \\( T_{BE} = 30 \\) seconds and \\( S_{BE} = 100 \\) miles per hour, we can calculate \\( T_{PF} \\):\n\n\\( T_{PF} = 30 \\times \\left( \\frac{100}{200} \\right) \\)\n\n\\( T_{PF} = 30 \\times 0.5 \\)\n\n\\( T_{PF} = 15 \\) seconds\n\nTherefore, it will take the peregrine falcon 15 seconds to dive the same distance as the bald eagle.####15"}
{"question": "When the machine is cold, as it is in the first hour of production, it takes 6 minutes to produce each molded flower pot.
