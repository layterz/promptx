{"question": "Kingsley's teacher instructed her to find four friends to help her carry some chairs to the school hall to be used for an upcoming event. If each student carried 5 chairs per trip and made 10 trips in total, what's the total number of chairs taken to the hall?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) be the total number of students carrying chairs, \\( T \\) be the number of trips made, and \\( C \\) be the number of chairs carried by each student per trip. The total number of chairs \\( Total_C \\) taken to the hall is given by:\n\n\\[ Total_C = N \\times T \\times C \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of chairs (\\( Total_C \\)) taken to the hall is the product of the number of students carrying chairs (\\( N \\)), the number of trips made (\\( T \\)), and the number of chairs carried by each student per trip (\\( C \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( N = 4 + 1 = 5 \\) students carrying chairs (Kingsley and her four friends)\n- \\( T = 10 \\) trips made (total number of trips)\n- \\( C = 5 \\) chairs carried by each student per trip\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ Total_C = 5 \\times 10 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ Total_C = 250 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of chairs taken to the hall is 250.####\n250"}
{"question": "Carly is trying to get in shape to try out for the soccer team. She starts by running 2 miles a week. The second week, she runs twice as long plus 3 extra miles per week. The third week she runs 9/7 as much as she ran the second week. The week after that, she sprains her ankle and has to reduce her running time by 5 miles per week. How many miles did she run the week she was injured?", "answer": "Let \\(W_1\\) represent the number of miles Carly runs in the first week. \n\nThe second week, Carly runs twice as long as the first week plus an additional 3 miles, so the total is \\(2W_1 + 3\\). \n\nThe third week, Carly runs \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\) of the distance she ran in the second week, so the total is \\(\\frac{9}{7}(2W_1 + 3)\\). \n\nThe week after that, Carly sprains her ankle and reduces her running time by 5 miles, so the total is \\(\\frac{9}{7}(2W_1 + 3) - 5\\). \n\nTo find the number of miles Carly ran when she was injured, we need to substitute the value of \\(W_1\\) into the equation. \n\nLet \\(W_1 = 2\\) (since Carly runs 2 miles in the first week).\n\nSubstituting \\(W_1 = 2\\) into the equation, we have:\n\n\\(\\frac{9}{7}(2(2) + 3) - 5\\) \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\\(\\frac{9}{7}(4 + 3) - 5\\) \n\n\\(\\frac{9}{7}(7) - 5\\) \n\n\\(\\frac{63}{7} - 5\\) \n\n\\(9 - 5\\) \n\n\\(4\\) \n\nTherefore, Carly ran 4 miles the week she was injured. \n#### 4"}
{"question": "Maria bought a ticket to a ZOO. The regular price stands at $15, but she was able to get a 40% discount.

The price of the ticket \\( P_T \\) after the discount is given by:\n\n\\[ P_T = P - \\left( \\frac{D}{100} \\right) \\times P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the price of the ticket after the discount (\\( P_T \\)) is the regular price (\\( P \\)) minus the discount percentage (\\( \\frac{D}{100} \\times P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = $15 \\) (regular price of the ticket)\n- \\( D = 40\\% \\) (discount percentage)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_T = $15 - \\left( \\frac{40}{100} \\right) \\times $15 \\]\n\\[ P_T = $15 - 0.4 \\times $15 \\]\n\\[ P_T = $15 - $6 \\]\n\\[ P_T = $9 \\]\n\nTherefore, Maria paid $9 for the ticket after getting a 40% discount.\n####\n9"}
{"question": "Joan is preparing sandwiches for a family potluck. She decides to make ham sandwiches and grilled cheese sandwiches. One ham sandwich requires 2 slices of cheese, and one grilled cheese sandwich requires 3 slices of cheese. She uses a total of 50 slices of cheese to make the sandwiches. If she makes 10 ham sandwiches, how many grilled cheese sandwiches does she make?", "answer": "Let \\( H \\) represent the number of ham sandwiches and \\( G \\) represent the number of grilled cheese sandwiches.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude:\n- One ham sandwich requires 2 slices of cheese, so the number of cheese slices used to make the ham sandwiches is \\( H \\times 2 \\).\n- One grilled cheese sandwich requires 3 slices of cheese.\n- The total number of cheese slices used to make the sandwiches is 50.\n\nUsing these conclusions, we can write the following equations:\n\n\\( H \\times 2 + G \\times 3 = 50 \\)   (equation 1)\n\\( G = ? \\)                        (equation 2)\n\nTo find the value of \\( G \\), we can solve equation 1 for \\( H \\) and substitute it into equation 2:\n\n\\( H = \\frac{50 - G \\times 3}{2} \\)\n\nSubstituting this expression for \\( H \\) into equation 2:\n\n\\( G = \\frac{50 - G \\times 3}{2} \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( 2G = 50 - 3G \\)\n\n\\( 5G = 50 \\)\n\n\\( G = \\frac{50}{5} \\)\n\n\\( G = 10 \\)\n\nTherefore, Joan makes 10 grilled cheese sandwiches.####\n10"}
