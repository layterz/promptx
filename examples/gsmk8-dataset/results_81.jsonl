{"question": "Marlon had 30 female baby bunnies in his hutch. They matured after four months, and he gave 2/5 of them to his friend Rodney. If after another three months the bunnies conceived and gave birth to 2 kittens each, calculate the total number of bunnies Marlon has in his hutch now.", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the total number of bunnies Marlon has in his hutch. \n\nBased on the information provided, we can break down the problem into the following steps:\n\n1. Marlon gave 2/5 of the bunnies to Rodney, which means he gave away \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times B \\) bunnies.\n2. Marlon remained with \\( B - \\frac{2}{5} \\times B \\) bunnies after giving some to Rodney.\n3. After three months, each bunny gave birth to 2 kittens, resulting in a total of \\( (B - \\frac{2}{5} \\times B) \\times 2 \\) kittens.\n4. Marlon now has \\( (B - \\frac{2}{5} \\times B) + (B - \\frac{2}{5} \\times B) \\times 2 \\) bunnies in total.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 30 \\) bunnies (initial number of bunnies)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\[ B = (30 - \\frac{2}{5} \\times 30) + (30 - \\frac{2}{5} \\times 30) \\times 2 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ B = 18 + 18 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ B = 18 + 36 \\]\n\\[ B = 54 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marlon now has a total of 54 bunnies in his hutch. \n####\n54"}
{"question": "Flies are Betty's frog's favorite food. Every day the frog eats 2 flies. Betty puts the flies she finds in a bottle. In the morning Betty catches 5 flies inside a bottle, and in the afternoon she catches 6 more, but when she removes the lid, one escapes.  Betty wants to gather the whole week's food for her frog. How many more flies does she need?", "answer": "Let \\( F_w \\) be the number of flies the frog eats in a week, \\( F_m \\) be the number of flies caught in the morning, \\( F_a \\) be the number of flies caught in the afternoon, and \\( F_e \\) be the number of flies that escape. The equation to find the number of flies \\( F_n \\) that Betty needs is given by:\n\n\\[ F_n = F_w - (F_m + F_a - F_e) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of flies Betty needs (\\( F_n \\)) is equal to the number of flies the frog eats in a week (\\( F_w \\)) minus the difference between the number of flies caught in the morning (\\( F_m \\)) and afternoon (\\( F_a \\)) and the number of flies that escape (\\( F_e \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( F_w = 2 \\) flies per day * 7 days per week = 14 flies per week\n- \\( F_m = 5 \\) flies caught in the morning\n- \\( F_a = 6 \\) flies caught in the afternoon\n- \\( F_e = 1 \\) fly that escapes\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ F_n = 14 - (5 + 6 - 1) \\]\n\\[ F_n = 14 - 10 \\]\n\\[ F_n = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Betty needs 4 more flies to gather the whole week's food for her frog.\n####\n4"}
{"question": "John buys a chair. He then buys a table that is 3 times the price of the chair. Then, he buys a couch that is 5 times the price of the table.
