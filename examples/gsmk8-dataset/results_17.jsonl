{"question": "Mel is three years younger than Katherine.  When Katherine is two dozen years old, how old will Mel be in years?", "answer": "Let \\( K \\) represent Katherine's age and \\( M \\) represent Mel's age. The relationship between their ages is that Mel is three years younger than Katherine, so we can express it as \\( M = K-3 \\).\n\nGiven:\n- Katherine will be \\( 2 \\) dozen years old, which is \\( 2 \\times 12 = 24 \\) years old.\n\nTo find Mel's age when Katherine is \\( 24 \\) years old, we substitute \\( K = 24 \\) into the equation:\n\n\\( M = 24 - 3 \\)\n\\( M = 21 \\)\n\nTherefore, when Katherine is \\( 24 \\) years old, Mel will be \\( 21 \\) years old.\n####\n21"}

The equation to find the length of the head start \\( S \\) that the turtle needs to finish in a tie is given by:\n\n\\[ S = V_t \\times (D / V_h) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the length of the head start \\( S \\) is equal to the speed of the turtle \\( V_t \\) multiplied by the time it takes for the hare to run the distance of the race \\( D \\) divided by the speed of the hare \\( V_h \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D = 20 \\) feet (distance of the race)\n- \\( V_h = 10 \\) feet/second (speed of the hare)\n- \\( V_t = 1 \\) foot/second (speed of the turtle)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 1 \\times (20 / 10) \\]\n\\[ S = 1 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ S = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the turtle needs a head start of 2 seconds to finish in a tie.\n####\n2"}
{"question": "Movie tickets cost $5 each on a Monday, twice as much on a Wednesday, and five times as much as Monday on a Saturday. If Glenn goes to the movie theater on Wednesday and Saturday, how much does he spend?", "answer": "Let \\(M\\) represent the cost of a movie ticket on a Monday, \\(W\\) represent the cost of a movie ticket on a Wednesday, and \\(S\\) represent the cost of a movie ticket on a Saturday. The total amount Glenn spends \\(T\\) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n\\[ T = W + S \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\(M = \\$5\\) (cost of a movie ticket on a Monday)\n\nSince the cost of a movie ticket on a Wednesday is twice as much as on a Monday, we can express \\(W\\) as \\(2M\\). Since the cost of a movie ticket on a Saturday is five times as much as on a Monday, we can express \\(S\\) as \\(5M\\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = 2M + 5M \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount Glenn spends \\(T\\) is the sum of the cost of the movie ticket on Wednesday (\\(2M\\)) and the cost of the movie ticket on Saturday (\\(5M\\)).\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 2 \\times \\$5 + 5 \\times \\$5 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$10 + \\$25 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$35 \\]\n\nTherefore, Glenn spends a total of \\$35 for movie tickets on Wednesday and Saturday combined.\n####\n35"}

And when riding on an uphill inclined slow, it travels at a speed 18 miles per hour slower than when it is riding on flat sand.  If Conner rides his dune buggy one-third of the time on flat sand, one-third of the time on uphill slopes, and one-third of the time on downhill slopes, what is his average speed in miles per hour?", "answer": "Let \\( S_f \\) be the speed on flat sand, \\( S_d \\) be the speed on downhill slopes, and \\( S_u \\) be the speed on uphill inclined slopes.

The total weight \\( W \\) of sugar sold every week is given by:\n\n\\[ W = P \\times G \\]\n\nSince 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams, we can convert the weight of sugar to kilograms by dividing by 1000. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{kilograms}} = \\frac{W}{1000} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the weight of sugar sold every week in kilograms (\\( W_{\\text{kilograms}} \\)) is the total weight of sugar sold every week in grams (\\( W \\)) divided by 1000.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 20 \\) packets (packets sold every week)\n- \\( G = 100 \\) grams (weight of each packet)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ W = 20 \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ W = 2000 \\]\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{kilograms}} = \\frac{2000}{1000} \\]\n\\[ W_{\\text{kilograms}} = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the store sells 2 kilograms of sugar every week.\n####\n2"}
