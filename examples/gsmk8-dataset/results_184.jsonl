{"question": "Jenny and Mark are throwing bottle caps. Jenny's bottlecap flies 18 feet straight, then bounces off a street light and flies another 1/3 of the distance it already went. Mark's bottle cap flies 15 feet forward, then bounces off a window and flies twice as far as it already did. How much further did Mark's bottle cap go than Jenny's?", "answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to find the distance that Jenny's bottlecap flies straight and bounces off the street light. We are told that it flies 18 feet straight and then bounces off and goes 1/3 of the distance it already went. So, we can find the distance it traveled after the bounce by taking 1/3 of 18 feet.\n\nLet \\( D_J \\) represent the total distance that Jenny's bottlecap traveled. The distance after the bounce is given by:\n\\[ D_{J, \\text{bounce}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot D_J \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total distance that Jenny's bottlecap traveled. This is the sum of the distance it flew straight and the distance after the bounce.\n\\[ D_J = 18 + D_{J, \\text{bounce}} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the distance that Mark's bottlecap flies straight and bounces off the window. We are told that it flies 15 feet straight and then bounces off and goes twice as far as it already did. So, we can find the distance it traveled after the bounce by multiplying the distance it flew straight by 2.\n\nLet \\( D_M \\) represent the total distance that Mark's bottlecap traveled. The distance after the bounce is given by:\n\\[ D_{M, \\text{bounce}} = 2 \\cdot 15 \\]\n\nAgain, we need to calculate the total distance that Mark's bottlecap traveled. This is the sum of the distance it flew straight and the distance after the bounce.\n\\[ D_M = 15 + D_{M, \\text{bounce}} \\]\n\nFinally, to find the difference in distance between Mark's and Jenny's bottlecaps, we subtract the distance Jenny's bottlecap traveled from the distance Mark's bottlecap traveled.\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = D_M - D_J \\]\n\nLet's apply these calculations to the given values:\n\nFor Jenny's bottlecap:\n\\[ D_{J, \\text{bounce}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 18 \\]\n\\[ D_J = 18 + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 18 \\]\n\nFor Mark's bottlecap:\n\\[ D_{M, \\text{bounce}} = 2 \\cdot 15 \\]\n\\[ D_M = 15 + 2 \\cdot 15 \\]\n\nNow, let's find the difference in distance:\n\\[ \\text{Difference} = D_M - D_J \\]\n\n#### 21"}
