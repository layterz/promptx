{"question": "If a rectangle has a width of 42 inches and an area of 1638, how many rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches?", "answer": "Let \\( L \\) represent the length of the rectangle, \\( W \\) represent the width of the rectangle, and \\( A \\) represent the area of the rectangle. The formula to find the length \\( L \\) of the rectangle is given by:\n\n\\[ A = L \\times W \\]\n\nThis equation states that the area of the rectangle \\( A \\) is equal to the length \\( L \\) times the width \\( W \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W = 42 \\) inches (width of the rectangle)\n- \\( A = 1638 \\) square inches (area of the rectangle)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 1638 = L \\times 42 \\]\n\nTo find the length \\( L \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ L = \\frac{1638}{42} \\]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n\\[ L = 39 \\]\n\nTherefore, the rectangle has a length of 39 inches.\n\nTo find the number of rectangles required to reach a length of 390 inches, we divide the total length by the length of one rectangle:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of rectangles} = \\frac{390}{39} \\]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of rectangles} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, 10 rectangles of the same size would reach a length of 390 inches.\n#### 10"}
{"question": "A camping site recorded a total of 150 campers for the past three weeks. Two weeks ago, there were 40 campers which was 10 more than the number of campers three weeks ago. How many campers were there last week?", "answer": "Let \\( C_W \\) represent the number of campers last week, \\( C_2 \\) represent the number of campers two weeks ago, and \\( C_3 \\) represent the number of campers three weeks ago.\n\nWe are given that two weeks ago, there were \\( 40 \\) campers which was \\( 10 \\) more than the number of campers three weeks ago. Therefore, \\( C_2 = C_3 + 10 \\).\n\nThe total number of campers for the past three weeks is \\( 150 \\), so we can express this as \\( C_3 + C_2 + C_W = 150 \\).\n\nGiven these equations, we can solve for \\( C_W \\).\n\nFrom the first equation, we have \\( C_2 - C_3 = 10 \\).\nFrom the second equation, we have \\( C_3 + C_2 + C_W = 150 \\).\n\nAdding the two equations together, we get:\n\\( 2C_2 = 160 \\)\n\\( C_2 = 80 \\)\n\nSubstituting this value back into the first equation, we have:\n\\( 80 - C_3 = 10 \\)\n\\( C_3 = 70 \\)\n\nFinally, substituting both values into the second equation, we have:\n\\( 70 + 80 + C_W = 150 \\)\n\\( C_W = 150 - 70 - 80 \\)\n\\( C_W = 80 \\)\n\nTherefore, there were 80 campers last week.\n####\n80"}
