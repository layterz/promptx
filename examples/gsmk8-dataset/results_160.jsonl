The total number of cookies \\( T_T \\) baked by Clementine, Jake, and Tory combined is given by:\n\n\\[ T_T = C + J + T \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Clementine baked 72 cookies (\\( C = 72 \\))\n- Jake baked twice as many cookies as Clementine (\\( J = 2C \\))\n- Tory baked half as many cookies as Jake and Clementine combined (\\( T = \\frac{1}{2}(C+J) \\))\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T_T = C + J + T \\]\n\\[ T_T = C + 2C + \\frac{1}{2}(C+J) \\]\n\\[ T_T = C + 2C + \\frac{1}{2}(C+2C) \\]\n\\[ T_T = C + 2C + \\frac{1}{2}(3C) \\]\n\\[ T_T = C + 2C + \\frac{3}{2}C \\]\n\\[ T_T = \\frac{2}{2}C + \\frac{4}{2}C + \\frac{3}{2}C \\]\n\\[ T_T = \\frac{9}{2}C \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of cookies baked by Clementine, Jake, and Tory combined is \\( \\frac{9}{2} \\) times the number of cookies baked by Clementine.\n\nGiven that they sell each cookie for $2, the total amount of money they make \\( M \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ M = T_T \\times \\text{price per cookie} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T_T = \\frac{9}{2}C \\) (total number of cookies baked)\n- price per cookie = $2\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ M = T_T \\times \\text{price per cookie} \\]\n\\[ M = \\frac{9}{2}C \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ M = \\frac{9}{2} \\times 2 \\times C \\]\n\\[ M = 9C \\]\n\nTherefore, they make $9 times the number of cookies baked by Clementine.\n\nGiven that Clementine baked 72 cookies, the amount of money they make is:\n\n\\[ M = 9 \\times 72 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ M = 648 \\]\n\nTherefore, they make $648 if they sell all their cookies.\n####\n648"}
{"question": "A dog is being treated for fleas. One flea treatment gets rid of half the fleas. After four treatments, the dog has 14 fleas left. How many more fleas did the dog have before the flea treatments than after?", "answer": "Let \\( F_i \\) represent the number of fleas after \\( i \\) treatments, and \\( F_0 \\) represent the number of fleas before any treatments. The equation to find the number of fleas \\( F_i \\) after \\( i \\) treatments is given by:\n\n\\[ F_i = F_{i-1} \\times 2 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of fleas \\( F_i \\) after \\( i \\) treatments is twice the number of fleas \\( F_{i-1} \\) before the previous treatment.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( F_4 = 14 \\) fleas (number of fleas after four treatments)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ F_3 = 14 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ F_3 = 28 \\]\n\n\\[ F_2 = 28 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ F_2 = 56 \\]\n\n\\[ F_1 = 56 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ F_1 = 112 \\]\n\n\\[ F_0 = 112 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ F_0 = 224 \\]\n\nTherefore, the dog had 210 more fleas before the treatments than after.\n####\n210"}
{"question": "Between them, Mark and Sarah have 24 traffic tickets. Mark has twice as many parking tickets as Sarah, and they each have an equal number of speeding tickets. If Sarah has 6 speeding tickets, how many parking tickets does Mark have?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) represent the number of parking tickets Mark has, and \\( S \\) represent the number of parking tickets Sarah has. \n\nGiven that Mark has twice as many parking tickets as Sarah, we can express \\( M \\) in terms of \\( S \\) as \\( M = 2S \\).\n\nWe also know that Mark and Sarah have a total of 24 traffic tickets, which includes parking tickets and speeding tickets. Since they each have an equal number of speeding tickets, and Sarah has 6 speeding tickets, the total number of speeding tickets is \\( 6 + 6 = 12 \\).\n\nTo find the number of parking tickets, we can subtract the combined number of speeding tickets from the total number of tickets:\n\n\\[ M + S = 24 - 12 \\]\n\\[ 2S + S = 12 \\]\n\\[ 3S = 12 \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( S \\) by dividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{12}{3} \\]\n\\[ S = 4 \\]\n\nTo find the number of parking tickets Mark has, we can multiply the number of parking tickets Sarah has by 2:\n\n\\[ M = 2S \\]\n\\[ M = 2(4) \\]\n\\[ M = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark has 8 parking tickets. \n####\n8"}

{"question": "Lindsey bought 2 exercise bands to intensify her workout.  Each band adds an extra 5 pounds of resistance to her workout.  If she doubles up both sets of bands and places them around her legs and picks up a 10-pound dumbbell, how much weight will she squat?", "answer": "Let \\(B\\) represent the weight added by each exercise band, \\(D\\) represent the weight of the dumbbells, and \\(W\\) represent the total weight Lindsey will squat. The equation to calculate the total weight is given by:\n\n\\[W = 2B + D\\]\n\nThis equation states that the total weight \\(W\\) is equal to twice the weight added by each exercise band (\\(2B\\)) plus the weight of the dumbbells (\\(D\\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(B = 5\\) pounds (weight added by each exercise band)\n- \\(D = 10\\) pounds (weight of the dumbbells)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[W = 2 \\times 5 + 10\\]\n\\[W = 10 + 10\\]\n\\[W = 20\\]\n\nTherefore, Lindsey will squat a total weight of 30 pounds.\n####\n30"}
{"question": "Wendy just started working at an Italian restaurant. She polished 50 small glasses and 10 more large glasses than small glasses.

The total number of glasses \\( G_T \\) polished by Wendy is given by:\n\n\\[ G_T = G_s + G_l \\]\n\nSince Wendy polished 10 more large glasses than small glasses, we can express \\( G_l \\) as \\( G_s + 10 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ G_T = G_s + (G_s + 10) \\]\n\\[ G_T = 2G_s + 10 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of glasses polished by Wendy (\\( G_T \\)) is twice the number of small glasses polished (\\( G_s \\)) plus 10.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( G_s = 50 \\) small glasses (small glasses polished by Wendy)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ G_T = 2 \\times 50 + 10 \\]\n\\[ G_T = 110 \\]\n\nTherefore, Wendy polished a total of 110 glasses.####\n110"}
