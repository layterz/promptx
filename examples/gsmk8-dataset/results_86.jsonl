{"question": "Erica lives near a lake where most locals sell fish as their main source of income, earning $20 per kg of fish. She goes out fishing today and catches twice as many fish as she caught in total in the past four months. If Erica trawled 80 kg of fish in the past four months, not including today, how much money will she have earned in the past four months including today (assuming she sells all her fish)?", "answer": "Let \\( P_{\\text{past}} \\) represent the total amount of fish caught in the past four months, and \\( P_{\\text{today}} \\) represent the amount of fish caught today. The total amount of fish caught \\( P_{\\text{total}} \\) in the past four months including today can be calculated by:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{total}} = P_{\\text{past}} + P_{\\text{today}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_{\\text{past}} = 80 \\) kg (fish caught in the past four months)\n- \\( P_{\\text{today}} = 2 \\times P_{\\text{past}} = 160 \\) kg (fish caught today, which is twice the amount caught in the past four months)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{total}} = 80 + 160 \\]\n\\[ P_{\\text{total}} = 240 \\]\n\nTherefore, Erica will have caught a total of 240 kg of fish in the past four months, including today. Multiplied by the selling price of $20 per kg, her total earnings will be $240 \\times $20 = $4800.####\n4800"}
