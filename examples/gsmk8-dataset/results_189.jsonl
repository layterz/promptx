{"question": "Angus, Patrick, and Ollie went fishing for trout on Rainbow Lake.  Angus caught 4 more fish than Patrick did, but Ollie caught 7 fewer fish than Angus.  If Ollie caught 5 fish, how many fish did Patrick catch?", "answer": "Let \\( A \\) represent the number of fish caught by Angus, \\( P \\) represent the number of fish caught by Patrick, and \\( O \\) represent the number of fish caught by Ollie. From the problem, we can deduce the following equations:\n\n\\( A = P + 4 \\) --- Equation 1\n\n\\( O = A - 7 \\) --- Equation 2\n\nGiven that \\( O = 5 \\), we can substitute this value into Equation 2 to solve for \\( A \\):\n\n\\( 5 = A - 7 \\)\n\n\\( A = 5 + 7 \\)  --- Equation 3\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( A \\) from Equation 3 into Equation 1, we can solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\( P = 5 + 7 - 4 \\)\n\n\\( P = 8 \\)\n\nTherefore, Patrick caught 8 fish. \n#### 8"}
