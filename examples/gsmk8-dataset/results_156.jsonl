{"question": "A baker sells pastries for $5 and works 7 days a week. On Monday he sold 2. Every day the number of sales increases by 1 compared to the previous day. On average, how many pastries does he sell on each day of the week?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the number of pastries sold each day. The average number of pastries sold \\( A \\) each day of the week is given by:\n\n\\[ A = \bfrac{{\\sum P}}{{7}} \\]\n\nTo calculate \\( A \\), we can add up the number of pastries sold each day from Monday to Sunday and divide by 7.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Monday: 2 pastries\n- Tuesday: 3 pastries\n- Wednesday: 4 pastries\n- Thursday: 5 pastries\n- Friday: 6 pastries\n- Saturday: 7 pastries\n- Sunday: 8 pastries\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ A = \bfrac{{(2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)}}{{7}} \\]\n\\[ A = \bfrac{{35}}{{7}} \\]\n\\[ A = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, the baker sells an average of 5 pastries per day for one week.\n####\n5"}

{"question": "Jorge is 24 years younger than Simon. In 2005, Jorge is 16 years old. In 2010, how old would Simon be?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent Simon's age and \\( J \\) represent Jorge's age. We are given that Jorge is 24 years younger than Simon, so we can express this as \\( J = S - 24 \\). \n\nIn 2005, we are given that Jorge is 16 years old, so we can substitute this into the equation to find Simon's age in 2005: \n\n\\( J = S - 24 \\)\n\\( 16 = S - 24 \\)\n\\( S = 16 + 24 \\)\n\\( S = 40 \\)\n\nSo in 2005, Simon was 40 years old. \n\nWe are also given that there are 5 years between 2005 and 2010. \n\nTo find Simon's age in 2010, we add 5 years to his age in 2005:\n\n\\( S_{2010} = 40 + 5 \\)\n\\( S_{2010} = 45 \\)\n\nTherefore, Simon would be 45 years old in 2010. \n####\n45"}
