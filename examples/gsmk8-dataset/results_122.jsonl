{"question": "A bag was originally priced at $500. A week after, the price was reduced by 5%. Since the bag was still not sold, the selling price was reduced by 4% a month after. How much was the total reduction from the original selling price?", "answer": "Let \\( P_o \\) be the original selling price of the bag, \\( R_1 \\) be the percentage reduction after a week, and \\( R_2 \\) be the percentage reduction after a month. The total reduction from the original selling price is given by:\n\n\\[ R_t = P_o \\times R_1 + P_o \\times R_2 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total reduction (\\( R_t \\)) is the sum of the reduction after a week (\\( P_o \\times R_1 \\)) and the reduction after a month (\\( P_o \\times R_2 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_o = \\$500 \\) (original selling price)\n- \\( R_1 = 5\\% \\) (percentage reduction after a week)\n- \\( R_2 = 4\\% \\) (percentage reduction after a month)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ R_t = \\$500 \\times \\frac{5}{100} + \\$500 \\times \\frac{4}{100} \\]\n\\[ R_t = \\$500 \\times 0.05 + \\$500 \\times 0.04 \\]\n\\[ R_t = \\$25 + \\$20 \\]\n\\[ R_t = \\$45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total reduction from the original selling price is \\$45.\n####\n44"}

{"question": "A pair of dogs are barking back and forth at each other from across the street. The poodle barks twice for every one time the terrier barks. The terrier\u2019s owner hushes it every second time it barks. She has to say \u201chush\u201d six times before the dogs stopped barking. How many times did the poodle bark?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the number of times the poodle barks and \\( T \\) represent the number of times the terrier barks. The number of times the poodle barks is twice the number of times the terrier barks, so we can express this relationship as:\n\n\\[ P = 2T \\]\n\nThe terrier is hushed every second time it barks, so the number of times the terrier barks is double the number of times it was told to hush. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:\n\n\\[ T = 2H \\]\n\nThe terrier was told to hush 6 times, so we can substitute \\( H \\) with 6:\n\n\\[ T = 2 \\times 6 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( T \\), we find:\n\n\\[ T = 12 \\]\n\nSubstituting this value of \\( T \\) into the equation for \\( P \\), we find:\n\n\\[ P = 2 \\times 12 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( P \\), we find:\n\n\\[ P = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the poodle barked a total of 24 times. \n####\n24"}
