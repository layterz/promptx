{"question": "Aubriella is pouring water into a 50-gallon fish tank at the rate of 1 gallon every 20 seconds. How many more gallons will she have to pour into the tank to fill the tank if she poured water into the fish tank for 6 minutes?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) be the total number of gallons in the fish tank, \\( R \\) be the rate of pouring water (in gallons per second), and \\( t \\) be the time taken to pour water into the tank (in seconds). The equation to find the number of gallons \\( P \\) to be poured into the tank is given by:\n\n\\[ P = R \\cdot t \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of gallons to be poured into the tank (\\( P \\)) is equal to the rate of pouring water (\\( R \\)) multiplied by the time taken to pour water into the tank (\\( t \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 50 \\) gallons (total number of gallons in the fish tank)\n- \\( R = \\frac{1}{20} \\) gallons per second (rate of pouring water)\n- \\( t = 6 \\times 60 \\) seconds (time taken to pour water into the tank, converted from 6 minutes)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{1}{20} \\cdot 6 \\times 60 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{1}{20} \\cdot 360 \\]\n\\[ P = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, Aubriella poured 18 gallons of water into the tank.\n\nTo find the number of more gallons (\\( M \\)) she will have to pour into the tank to fill it completely, we subtract the amount of water poured (\\( P \\)) from the total capacity of the tank (\\( T \\)):\n\n\\[ M = T - P \\]\n\\[ M = 50 - 18 \\]\n\\[ M = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, Aubriella will have to pour 32 more gallons into the tank to fill it completely.\n\n####\n32"}
{"question": "Porter is a painter who creates beautiful paintings of wild animals.  Most recently, he painted a mural of a pack of wolves standing on a snowy-white mountainside underneath a full moon.  He put the painting up for auction and it sold for $1000 less than five times more than he had made on his previous painting.  If he received $44,000 for the sale of his most recent painting, how much, in dollars, did he make for selling his previous painting?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the amount Porter made for selling his previous painting, and let \\( S \\) represent the sale price of his most recent painting.\n\nGiven that the sale price of Porter's most recent painting is $1000 less than five times what he made on his previous painting, we can express this as:\n\n\\[ S = 5P - 1000 \\]\n\nTo find out how much Porter made for selling his previous painting, we can rearrange the equation to solve for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ 5P = S + 1000 \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{S + 1000}{5} \\]\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{44000 + 1000}{5} \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{45000}{5} \\]\n\\[ P = 9000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Porter made $9,000 for selling his previous painting.\n####\n9,000"}
