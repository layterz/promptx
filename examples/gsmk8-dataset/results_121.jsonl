{"question": "John used to go to the gym multiple times a weak but because of lockdowns he hasn't been able to go.  He used to lift 700 for squat, 400 for bench, and 800 for deadlift.  For squat he lost 30% of his lift.  He didn't lose any weight on bench because he was able to train that at home and he lost 200 pounds on deadlift.  What is his new total?", "answer": "Let's break down the given information step by step:\n\n- John used to lift 700 pounds for squat, 400 pounds for bench, and 800 pounds for deadlift.\n- He lost 30% of his lift on squat, which is calculated as: 700 * 0.3 = 210 pounds. So his new squat weight is: 700 - 210 = 490 pounds.\n- He didn't lose any weight on bench because he was able to train at home, so his bench weight remains the same at 400 pounds.\n- He lost 200 pounds on deadlift, so his new deadlift weight is: 800 - 200 = 600 pounds.\n\nTo calculate his new total weight, we add up his new weights for squat, bench, and deadlift:\n\nTotal weight = new squat weight + bench weight + new deadlift weight\nTotal weight = 490 + 400 + 600\nTotal weight = 1490 pounds.\n\nTherefore, John's new total weight is 1490 pounds. ####\n1490"}
