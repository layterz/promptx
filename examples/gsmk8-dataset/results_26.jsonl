{"question": "Charles is jogging while listening to his favorite album. He runs at 6 MPH when he's got music on and 4 MPH when he doesn't. His album is 40 minutes long. How many minutes will it take him to jog 6 miles?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the distance that Charles runs, \\( S_M \\) represent his speed while listening to music, and \\( S_NM \\) represent his speed without music. The time it will take him to jog a certain distance \\( T_D \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T_D = \\frac{D}{S} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Charles runs 6 miles.\n\nTo find the time it will take him to jog 6 miles, we need to calculate his speed both with and without music.\n\nHis speed with music is given as 6 MPH. To express this speed in miles per minute, we divide it by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). Therefore:\n\n\\[ S_M = \\frac{6}{60} = 0.1 \\] miles per minute\n\nNext, we calculate the distance he can run while the album is playing. The album is 40 minutes long, and his speed with music is 0.1 miles per minute. Therefore:\n\n\\[ D_M = 40 \\times 0.1 = 4 \\] miles\n\nTo find the remaining distance that he needs to run without music, we subtract the distance he can run with music from the total distance:\n\n\\[ D_{NM} = 6 - 4 = 2 \\] miles\n\nHis speed without music is given as 4 MPH. To express this speed in miles per minute, we divide it by 60:\n\n\\[ S_{NM} = \\frac{4}{60} = \\frac{1}{15} \\] miles per minute\n\nNow, we can calculate the time it will take him to run the remaining distance without music. We divide the distance by his speed without music:\n\n\\[ T_{NM} = \\frac{D_{NM}}{S_{NM}} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{15}} = 30 \\] minutes\n\nFinally, to find the total time it will take him to jog 6 miles, we add the time he spends with music (40 minutes) and the time he spends without music (30 minutes):\n\n\\[ T_{total} = 40 + 30 = 70 \\] minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Charles a total of 70 minutes to jog 6 miles.\n####\n70"}
{"question": "Hershel has 10 betta fish and 15 goldfish in a bowl. His friend Bexley brings him 2/5 times as many betta fish and 1/3 times as many goldfish.

The equation to calculate the amount of water in the tank (\\( W_r \\)) at the end of the heavy rain is:\n\n\\[ W_r = W + R \\cdot T \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount of water in the tank at the end of the heavy rain (\\( W_r \\)) is equal to the initial amount of water in the tank (\\( W \\)) plus the rate at which water flows into the tank (\\( R \\)) multiplied by the time (\\( T \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W = 100 \\) L (initial amount of water in the tank)\n- \\( R = 2 \\) L/min (rate at which water flows into the tank)\n- \\( T = 90 \\) min (duration of the heavy rain)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ W_r = 100 + 2 \\cdot 90 \\]\n\\[ W_r = 100 + 180 \\]\n\\[ W_r = 280 \\]\n\nTherefore, at the end of the heavy rain, there will be a total of 280 L of water in the tank.\n####\n280"}
