{"question": "Buoys are placed in the ocean at even intervals away from the beach to help swimmers monitor how far away from the beach they have swum. If a swimmer reaches the third buoy, they have swum out 72 meters. How many meters from the beach is the fourth buoy?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) be the distance from the beach to the first buoy, and \\( n \\) be the number of buoys. The equation to find the distance from the beach to the \\( n \\)-th buoy \\( D_n \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ D_n = D \\times n \\]\n\nThis equation states that the distance from the beach to the \\( n \\)-th buoy is equal to the distance from the beach to the first buoy multiplied by the number of buoys.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D_n = 72 \\) meters (distance to the third buoy)\n- \\( n = 4 \\) (number of buoys)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ D_n = D \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ 72 = D \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ D = \\frac{72}{4} \\]\n\\[ D = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance from the beach to the fourth buoy is 18 meters.\n####\n18"}
