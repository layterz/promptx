{"question": "Every time she goes to the store, Felicity gets a lollipop. After she finishes them, she uses the sticks to build a fort. The fort needs 400 sticks to finish it. Her family goes to the store three times a week and she always goes. If the fort is 60% complete, how many weeks has Felicity been collecting lollipops for?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the number of sticks Felicity has collected, \\( W \\) represent the number of weeks she has been collecting sticks, and \\( N \\) represent the number of times Felicity goes to the store in a week. \n\nThe equation to find the number of sticks \\( S \\) Felicity has collected is given by:\n\n\\[ S = N \\times W \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of sticks \\( S \\) is the product of the number of weeks \\( W \\) Felicity has been collecting sticks and the number of times \\( N \\) she goes to the store in a week.\n\nGiven:\n- The fort is 60% complete, so \\( S \\) is 60% of the total number of sticks needed to finish the fort, which is 400.\n- \\( N = 3 \\) (Felicity goes to the store 3 times a week)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\[ S = N \\times W \\]\n\\[ 240 = 3 \\times W \\]\n\\[ W = \\frac{240}{3} \\]\n\\[ W = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, Felicity has been collecting lollipops sticks for 80 weeks.\n#### 80"}
{"question": "Jim is wondering how many miles each gallon of gas gets him. His gas tank is 12 gallons. He has 2/3 of a tank left after he drives to and from work, which is 10 miles away from his house.

{"question": "Jimmy is setting up a garden. He has three plots: one plot for green beans, one plot for carrots, and one plot for corn. Each corn plant produces 5 times as many servings of veggies as each carrot, and each green bean plant produces half as many servings as each corn plant. If each carrot produces 4 servings of vegetables, and each plot has 9 plants, how many servings of vegetables is Jimmy growing?", "answer": "Let's start by defining the variables:\n- Let \\( C \\) represent the number of servings produced by each carrot plant.\n- Let \\( G \\) represent the number of servings produced by each green bean plant.\n- Let \\( N_C \\) represent the number of carrot plants.\n- Let \\( N_G \\) represent the number of green bean plants.\n- Let \\( N_C \\) represent the number of corn plants.\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- \\( C = 4 \\) servings (number of servings produced by each carrot plant)\n- \\( G = \\frac{1}{2} \\times C = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 = 2 \\) servings (number of servings produced by each green bean plant, which is half the number of servings produced by each carrot plant)\n- \\( N_C = N_G = N_C = 9 \\) plants (number of plants for each type - carrots, green beans, corn)\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of servings of vegetables produced by each type of plant:\n- Number of servings produced by carrot plants = \\( C \\times N_C = 4 \\times 9 = 36 \\) servings\n- Number of servings produced by green bean plants = \\( G \\times N_G = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\) servings\n- Number of servings produced by corn plants = \\( C \\times 5 \\times N_C = 4 \\times 5 \\times 9 = 180 \\) servings\n\nFinally, we can calculate the total number of servings of vegetables produced by all types of plants:\n- Total number of servings = number of servings produced by carrot plants + number of servings produced by green bean plants + number of servings produced by corn plants = 36 + 18 + 180 = 234 servings\n\nTherefore, Jimmy is growing a total of 306 servings of vegetables."}
