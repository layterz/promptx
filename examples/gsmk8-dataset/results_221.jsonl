{"question": "Kaiden and Adriel were to pick a certain number of apples from their farm. After picking 400 apples each, they realized they still had to pick some more, so each picked 3/4 times as many as they had picked earlier. When they checked the pickup truck that was carrying the apples, they found out they still needed to pick 600 apples each to reach the target number. How many apples were they targeting to pick?", "answer": "Let \\( A_1 \\) represent the number of apples picked by Kaiden and Adriel each in the first round, and \\( A_2 \\) represent the number of apples picked by them each in the second round. The total number of apples picked by Kaiden and Adriel (\\( A_T \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ A_T = 2(A_1) \\]\n\nSince they picked 3/4 times as many apples in the second round as they did in the first round, we can express \\( A_2 \\) as \\( \\frac{3}{4}A_1 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ A_T = 2(A_1) + 2\\left(\\frac{3}{4}A_1\\right) \\]\n\\[ A_T = 2A_1 + \\frac{3}{2}A_1 \\]\n\\[ A_T = \\frac{7}{2}A_1 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of apples picked by Kaiden and Adriel (\\( A_T \\)) is 7/2 times the number of apples picked by them each in the first round (\\( A_1 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A_T = 400 \\) apples (apples picked each in the first round)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ A_T = \\frac{7}{2} \\times 400 \\]\n\\[ A_T = 1400 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kaiden and Adriel picked a total of 1400 apples in the first and second rounds combined.\n\nTo find the target number of apples, we need to add the remaining 600 apples they still needed to pick:\n\n\\[ \\text{Target number of apples} = A_T + 2(600) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Target number of apples} = 1400 + 1200 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Target number of apples} = 2600 \\]\n\nTherefore, the target number of apples they needed to pick is 2600.\n####\n2600"}
