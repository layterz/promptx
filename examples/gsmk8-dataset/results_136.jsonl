{"question": "Haley is getting ready to watch a comet fly over her house. She spends two hours shopping for a telescope, half an hour getting everything set up in the backyard, three times the setup time making snacks, and 20 minutes watching the comet. What percentage of the total time she spent on all those activities was spent watching the comet, rounded to the nearest percent?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) be the total time Haley spent on all the activities, and \\( t_c \\) be the time Haley spent watching the comet. The percentage of the total time spent watching the comet \\( P_c \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ P_c = \frac{t_c}{T} \\times 100% \\]\n\nThis equation states that the percentage of time spent watching the comet (\\( P_c \\)) is the ratio of the time spent watching the comet (\\( t_c \\)) to the total time spent on all activities (\\( T \\)), multiplied by 100%.\n\nGiven:\n- Haley spent 2 hours shopping for a telescope, which is equivalent to 120 minutes\n- Haley spent half an hour getting everything set up in the backyard, which is equivalent to 30 minutes\n- Haley spent three times the setup time making snacks, which is 3 * 30 minutes = 90 minutes\n- Haley spent 20 minutes watching the comet\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_c = \frac{20}{120 + 30 + 90 + 20} \\times 100% \\]\n\\[ P_c = \frac{20}{260} \\times 100% \\]\n\\[ P_c = 0.076923 \\times 100% \\]\n\\[ P_c = 7.6923...% \\]\n\nRounded to the nearest percent, the percentage of the total time spent watching the comet is 8%.\n\nTherefore, Haley spent 8% of the total time watching the comet. \n####\n8"}
{"question": "Will's breakfast supplied him 900 calories of energy. Then he decided to jog for half an hour, which used up 10 calories of energy per minute. What is Will's net calorie intake after jogging?", "answer": "Let \\( E_B \\) represent the energy from breakfast in calories, \\( E_J \\) represent the energy used for jogging in calories, and \\( E_N \\) represent the net calorie intake after jogging. The net calorie intake can be calculated by subtracting the energy used for jogging from the energy from breakfast, and the energy used for jogging can be calculated by multiplying the energy used per minute by the number of minutes of jogging. Therefore, the equation to find the net calorie intake is:\n\n\\[ E_N = E_B - E_J \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( E_B = 900 \\) calories (energy from breakfast)\n- \\( E_J = 10 \\) calories per minute (energy used for jogging per minute)\n- Jogging for half an hour is 60/2 = 30 minutes\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\[ E_N = 900 - 10 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ E_N = 900 - 300 \\]\n\\[ E_N = 600 \\]\n\nTherefore, Will's net calorie intake after jogging is 600 calories.\n####\n600"}
{"question": "Victory and Sam have saved money for their holiday spending. Victory saves $100 less than Sam. If Sam saves $1000, how much is the total money saved for holiday spending?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the amount of money Sam saves, and \\( V \\) represent the amount of money Victory saves. The total amount of money saved for holiday spending \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = S + V \\]\n\nGiven that Victory saves $100 less than Sam, we can express Victory's savings as \\( V = S - 100 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = S + S - 100 \\]\n\\[ T = 2S - 100 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount of money saved for holiday spending (\\( T \\)) is twice the amount Sam saves (\\( S \\)) minus $100.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = $1000 \\) (amount of money Sam saves)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 2 \times $1000 - $100 \\]\n\\[ T = $2000 - $100 \\]\n\\[ T = $1900 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of money saved for holiday spending is $1900.\n####\n1900"}
