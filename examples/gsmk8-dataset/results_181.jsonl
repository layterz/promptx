{"question": "Carla adds a can of chilis, two cans of beans, and 50% more tomatoes than beans to a normal batch of chili. If she makes a quadruple batch, how many cans of food does she need?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the number of cans of tomatoes in a normal batch of chili, \\( B \\) represent the number of cans of beans in a normal batch of chili, \\( C \\) represent the number of cans of chilis in a normal batch of chili, and \\( F \\) represent the number of cans of food in a normal batch of chili. The equation to find the total number of cans of food \\( F_T \\) needed for a quadruple batch of chili is given by:\n\n\\[ F_T = (T + B + C) \\times 4 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of cans of food \\( F_T \\) needed for a quadruple batch is equal to the sum of the number of cans of tomatoes, beans, and chilis in a normal batch, multiplied by 4.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 2 \\) cans (number of cans of tomatoes in a normal batch)\n- \\( B = 2 \\) cans (number of cans of beans in a normal batch)\n- \\( C = B \\times 150\\% = 2 \\times 1.5 = 3 \\) cans (number of cans of chilis in a normal batch)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ F_T = (2 + 2 + 3) \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ F_T = 7 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ F_T = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, Carla needs a total of 28 cans of food for a quadruple batch of chili. \n####\n28"}
