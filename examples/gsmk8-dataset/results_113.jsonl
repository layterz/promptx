{"question": "Working together, four pugs can clean their house in 45 minutes. In how many minutes will 15 pugs working together be able to clean their house?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) be the time it takes for one pug to clean the house alone, \\( P \\) be the number of pugs, and \\( T_{\\text{together}} \\) be the time it takes for \\( P \\) pugs to clean the house together. The equation to find \\( T_{\\text{together}} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{together}} = \\frac{T}{P} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the time it takes for \\( P \\) pugs to clean the house together (\\( T_{\\text{together}} \\)) is the time for one pug to clean the house alone (\\( T \\)) divided by the number of pugs (\\( P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 180 \\) minutes (time for one pug to clean the house alone)\n- \\( P = 4 \\) pugs (number of pugs)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{together}} = \\frac{180}{4} \\]\n\\[ T_{\\text{together}} = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, four pugs working together can clean their house in 45 minutes.\n\nNow let's find the time it takes for fifteen pugs to clean their house together.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 15 \\) pugs (number of pugs)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{together}} = \\frac{180}{15} \\]\n\\[ T_{\\text{together}} = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, fifteen pugs working together will be able to clean their house in 12 minutes.\n####\n12"}
{"question": "Rick held a fundraiser and is figuring out who still owes money. He marked on a sheet how much everyone has promised to contribute, but he forgot to note how much some people had actually paid. Altogether, everyone has promised to contribute $400, and Rick has actually received $285.  Sally, Amy, Derek, and Carl all still owe money. Sally and Carl both owe equal amounts, Amy owes $30, and Derek owes half as much as Amy. How much, in dollars, do Sally and Carl each owe?", "answer": "Let \\(O\\) represent the total amount owed, \\(A\\) represent the amount Amy owes, and \\(S\\) represent the amount both Sally and Carl owe.
