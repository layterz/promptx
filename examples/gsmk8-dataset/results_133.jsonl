{"question": "Grayson has 100 questions on a test. He answers some of the questions for 2 hours, taking two minutes for each answer, then realizes he doesn't know the rest of the questions. How many questions does Grayson leave unanswered when he submits his test?", "answer": "Let \\( Q \\) be the total number of questions on the test, \\( H \\) be the number of hours Grayson spent answering questions, and \\( M \\) be the total number of minutes Grayson spent on the test.\n\nThe equation to find the number of questions \\( Q_u \\) unanswered by Grayson is given by:\n\n\\[ Q_u = Q - \\left( \\frac{M}{2} \\right) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of unanswered questions (\\( Q_u \\)) is equal to the total number of questions (\\( Q \\)) minus the number of questions Grayson answered (\\( \\frac{M}{2} \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( Q = 100 \\) questions (total number of questions on the test)\n- Grayson spent \\( H = 2 \\) hours answering questions\n- Grayson took \\( M = 2 \\) minutes to answer each question\n\nConverting hours to minutes:\n- 1 hour = 60 minutes\n- Grayson spent \\( H \\times 60 = 2 \\times 60 = 120 \\) minutes on the test\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ Q_u = 100 - \\left( \\frac{120}{2} \\right) \\]\n\\[ Q_u = 100 - 60 \\]\n\\[ Q_u = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, Grayson leaves 40 questions unanswered when he submits his test.\n####\n40"}
{"question": "Half of Taylor's house guests like weak coffee and the other half like strong coffee in the morning.  Taylor uses 1 tablespoon of coffee per cup of water to make it weak and he doubles that amount to make it strong.  If he makes 12 cups of both weak and strong coffee, how many tablespoons of coffee will he need?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) represent the number of cups of weak coffee and \\( S \\) represent the number of cups of strong coffee. The equation to find the total number of tablespoons of coffee used \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = 1 \\times W + 2 \\times S \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of tablespoons of coffee used (\\( T \\)) is the sum of the product of 1 tablespoon per cup of water and the number of cups of weak coffee (\\( W \\)), and the product of 2 tablespoons per cup of water and the number of cups of strong coffee (\\( S \\)). \n\nGiven:\n- There are 12 cups of both weak and strong coffee.\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 1 \\times 12 + 2 \\times 12 \\]\n\\[ T = 12 + 24 \\]\n\\[ T = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, Taylor will need a total of 36 tablespoons of coffee. \n####\n36"}

How many bills does Samuel have in his wallet?", "answer": "Let \\( B_5, B_{10}, \\) and \\( B_{20} \\) represent the number of $5, $10, and $20 bills, respectively. The total amount of money \\( M_T \\) in Samuel's wallet is given by:\n\n\\[ M_T = 5B_5 + 10B_{10} + 20B_{20} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( B_{10} \\) has an amount of $50 and there are 4 \\( B_{20} \\) bills, we can express \\( B_{10} \\) and \\( B_{20} \\) in terms of the number of $5 bills \\( B_5 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ M_T = 5B_5 + 10(5B_5) + 20(4B_5) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount of money \\( M_T \\) in Samuel's wallet is the sum of the amounts of each type of bill.\n\nGiven:\n- $10-bills amount to $50\n- 4 $20-bills\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ M_T = 5B_5 + 10(5B_5) + 20(4B_5) \\]\n\\[ 150 = 5B_5 + 50B_5 + 80B_5 \\]\n\\[ 150 = 135B_5 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( B_5 \\):\n\n\\[ B_5 = \\frac{150}{135} \\]\n\\[ B_5 = 1.111 \\]\n\nSince \\( B_5 \\) represents the number of $5 bills, we can't have a fractional number of bills.
