{"question": "Walter works 5 days a week in a fast-food chain and earns $5 per hour. Since he is a working student, he can only work 4 hours a day and allocates 3/4 of his weekly earning for his schooling. How much does he allocate for school?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) be the number of days Walter works in a week, \\( H \\) be the number of hours Walter works in a day, and \\( R \\) be Walter's hourly rate. The equation to find the total earnings \\( E \\) in a week is given by:\n\n\\[ E = W \\times H \\times R \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total earnings (\\( E \\)) is the product of the number of days worked in a week (\\( W \\)), the number of hours worked in a day (\\( H \\)), and the hourly rate (\\( R \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W = 5 \\) days (days Walter works in a week)\n- \\( H = 4 \\) hours (hours Walter works in a day)\n- \\( R = \\$5 \\) per hour (Walter's hourly rate)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ E = 5 \\times 4 \\times \\$5 \\]\n\\[ E = 20 \\times \\$5 \\]\n\\[ E = \\$100 \\]\n\nTherefore, Walter earns $100 per week.\n\nLet \\( A \\) be the amount Walter allocates for school, and \\( F \\) be the fraction of his weekly earnings allocated for school (\\( F = \\frac{3}{4} \\)). The equation to find the amount allocated for school (\\( A \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ A = E \\times F \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount allocated for school (\\( A \\)) is the product of the total earnings (\\( E \\)) and the fraction (\\( F \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( E = \\$100 \\) (total earnings in a week)\n- \\( F = \\frac{3}{4} \\) (fraction allocated for school)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ A = \\$100 \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\\[ A = \\$75 \\]\n\nTherefore, Walter allocates $75 for his school.\n\n#### 75"}
{"question": "Nigel won $45 but gave some away. His mother gave him $80 more. If now Nigel has $10 more than twice the amount he originally had, how much money did he give away?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) represent the amount of money Nigel originally won, \\( M_g \\) represent the amount of money Nigel gave away, and \\( M_m \\) represent the amount of money Nigel's mother gave him. The equation to find the amount of money Nigel gave away \\( M_g \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ M = 2M_g + 10 \\]\n\nThis equation states that twice the amount Nigel originally had (\\( 2M \\)) added with 10 dollars is equal to the amount of money Nigel currently has (\\( M \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( M = 45 \\) dollars (the amount Nigel originally won)\n- \\( M_m = 80 \\) dollars (the amount Nigel's mother gave him)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 45 = 2M_g + 10 \\]\n\\[ 2M_g = 45 - 10 \\]\n\\[ 2M_g = 35 \\]\n\\[ M_g = \\frac{35}{2} \\]\n\\[ M_g = 17.5 \\]\n\nTherefore, Nigel gave away 17.5 dollars."}
{"question": "Donna is catering for a party. She makes 20 sandwiches and then cuts them in half, before cutting them in half again. She then gives everyone 8 portions. How many people can she feed?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the number of people that Donna can feed.\n        \nTo find the number of people she can feed, we need to determine the overall number of portions. \n\nFirst, Donna makes 20 sandwiches and then cuts them in half, which gives us \\( 20 \\times 2 \\) portions after the first halving.\n\nNext, she cuts the portions in half again, giving us \\( (20 \\times 2) \\times 2 \\) portions after the second halving.\n\nLastly, we divide the total number of portions by the number of portions each person will be served, which is 8.\n\nThus, we get the equation:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{(20 \\times 2) \\times 2}{8} \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we have:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{(40) \\times 2}{8} \\]\n\\[ P = \\frac{80}{8} \\]\n\\[ P = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Donna can feed 10 people. \n####\n10"}
{"question": "The area of square A is 25. The area of square B is 81. What's the length difference between the sides of square A and B?", "answer": "Let \\(A\\) represent the side length of Square A and \\(B\\) represent the side length of Square B.\n\nThe area of a square is calculated as length * width. Since all sides of a square are equal, we can say that given a side \\(S\\), the area is \\(S * S\\).\n\nFor Square A, with side length \\(A\\), the area is \\(A * A = 25\\) or \\(A^2 = 25\\).

Solving for \\(B\\), we know that \\(B = 9\\).\n\nThe side difference between Square A and Square B is \\(B - A\\) or \\(9 - 5 = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the length difference between the sides of Square A and B is 4.\n####\n4"}
{"question": "John's piggy bank contains quarters, dimes, and nickels.  He has three more dimes than quarters and 6 fewer nickels than quarters.  If he has 63 coins, how many quarters does John have?", "answer": "Let \\( Q \\) represent the number of quarters John has. \n\nGiven:\n- John has 3 more dimes than quarters, so the number of dimes is \\( Q + 3 \\). \n- John has 6 fewer nickels than quarters, so the number of nickels is \\( Q - 6 \\). \n- John has a total of 63 coins, so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ Q + (Q + 3) + (Q - 6) = 63 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 3Q - 3 = 63 \\]\n\\[ 3Q = 66 \\]\n\\[ Q = \\frac{66}{3} \\]\n\\[ Q = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, John has 22 quarters.\n####\n22"}
{"question": "Marcia's hair is 24\" long at the beginning of the school year.  She cuts half of her hair off and lets it grow out 4 more inches.  She then cuts off another 2\" of hair.

{"question": "Katya sold 8 glasses of lemonade and Ricky sold 9 glasses of lemonade. If Tina sold twice as many as Katya and Ricky's combined sales, how many more glasses of lemonade than Katya did Tina sell?", "answer": "Let \\( K \\) represent the number of glasses of lemonade sold by Katya, \\( R \\) represent the number of glasses of lemonade sold by Ricky, and \\( T \\) represent the number of glasses of lemonade sold by Tina. The number of glasses of lemonade sold by Tina (\\( T \\)) can be expressed as twice the combined sales of Katya and Ricky (\\( K + R \\)). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = 2(K + R) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of glasses of lemonade sold by Tina (\\( T \\)) is twice the sum of the sales of Katya (\\( K \\)) and Ricky (\\( R \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( K = 8 \\) glasses (glasses of lemonade sold by Katya)\n- \\(R = 9 \\) glasses (glasses of lemonade sold by Ricky)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 2(8 + 9) \\]\n\\[ T = 2(17) \\]\n\\[ T = 34 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tina sold 34 glasses of lemonade. To find the number of glasses of lemonade that Tina sold more than Katya, we subtract Katya's sales from Tina's sales:\n\n\\[ \\text{{More glasses of lemonade than Katya}} = T - K \\]\n\\[ \\text{{More glasses of lemonade than Katya}} = 34 - 8 \\]\n\\[ \\text{{More glasses of lemonade than Katya}} = 26 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tina sold 26 more glasses of lemonade than Katya.\n####\n26"}
