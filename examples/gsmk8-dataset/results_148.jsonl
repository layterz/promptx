{"question": "Arthur wants to sell his basketball card collection and use the money to buy comic books. The store owner tells him that each card is worth 5 cents and comic books cost $6 each. If Arthur sells all 2,000 cards of his and buys as many comic books as he can, how much money does he have leftover?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the number of cards Arthur has, \\( V_C \\) represent the value of each card, \\( N_CB \\) represent the number of comic books Arthur can buy, and \\( P_CB \\) represent the price of each comic book. The equation to find the amount of money Arthur has leftover \\( L \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ L = (C \\times V_C) - (N_CB \\times P_CB) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount of money Arthur has leftover \\( L \\) is the difference between the total value of his cards and the cost of the comic books he can buy.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 2000 \\) cards (total number of cards Arthur has)\n- \\( V_C = 0.05 \\) cents (value of each card)\n- \\( P_CB = $6 \\) (price of each comic book)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ L = (2000 \\times 0.05) - (N_CB \\times 6) \\]\n\nSince it is not specified how many comic books Arthur can buy, we will use the estimate of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) (\\( \\frac{2000}{3} \\)) as mentioned in the answer:\n\n\\[ L = (2000 \\times 0.05) - ( \\frac{2000}{3} \\times 6) \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ L = 100 - 400 \\]\n\n\\[ L = -300 \\]\n\nTherefore, Arthur has -$300 leftover. This means he owes $300 instead.\n\n####\n-300"}
