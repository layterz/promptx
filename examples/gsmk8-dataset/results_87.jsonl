{"question": "Together 3 friends watched 411 short videos. Kelsey watched 43 more than Ekon. Ekon watched 17 less than Uma. How many videos did Kelsey watch?", "answer": "Let \\( U \\) represent the number of videos Uma watched, \\( Ekon = U - 17 \\), and \\( Kelsey = (U - 17) + 43 = U + 26 \\). The equation to find the number of videos \\( Kelsey \\) watched is given by:\n\n\\[ U + U - 17 + U + 26 = 411 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the sum of the number of videos watched by Uma (\\( U \\)), Ekon (\\( U - 17 \\)), and Kelsey (\\( U + 26 \\)) is equal to 411.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( U = \\) the number of videos Uma watched\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 3U + 9 = 411 \\]\n\\[ 3U = 402 \\]\n\\[ U = 134 \\]\n\nTherefore, Uma watched 134 videos.\nTo find the number of videos Kelsey watched:\n\n\\[ Kelsey = 134 + 26 = 160 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kelsey watched 160 videos.\n####\n160"}
{"question": "Tall Tuna has twice as many fish as Jerk Tuna. If Jerk Tuna has one hundred forty-four fish, how many fish do they have together?", "answer": "Let \\( JF \\) represent the number of fish that Jerk Tuna has, and \\( TF \\) represent the number of fish that Tall Tuna has. The total number of fish \\( TF \\) and \\( JF \\) have together is given by:\n\n\\[ TF + JF \\]\n\nSince Tall Tuna has twice as many fish as Jerk Tuna, we can express \\( TF \\) as \\( 2 \\times JF \\).
