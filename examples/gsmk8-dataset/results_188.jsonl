{"question": "Carlson bought land that cost $8000 and additional land that cost $4000. He initially owned 300 square meters of land. If the land he bought costs $20 per square meter, how big is his land after buying the new land?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the size of the land Carlson bought, \\( S_A \\) represent the size of the additional land Carlson bought, and \\( S_I \\) represent the initial size of land Carlson owned. The equation to find the total size of land \\( S_T \\) Carlson owns after buying the new land is given by:\n\n\\[ S_T = S + S_A + S_I \\]\n\nSince the cost of land is $20 per square meter, we can express the size of the land as the cost divided by $20. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ S_T = \\frac{8000}{20} + \\frac{4000}{20} + 300 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ S_T = 400 + 200 + 300 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 900 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total size of land Carlson owns after buying the new land is 900 square meters.\n####\n900"}
