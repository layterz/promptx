{"question": "Angela is a bike messenger in New York. She needs to deliver 8 times as many packages as meals. If she needs to deliver 27 meals and packages combined, how many meals does she deliver?", "answer": "Let \\( p \\) be the number of packages Angela delivers and \\( m \\) be the number of meals. We know that \\( p + m = 27 \\) and \\( p = 8m \\).\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get \\( 8m + m = 27 \\).\n\nCombining like terms, we get \\( 9m = 27 \\).\n\nDividing both sides by 9, we get \\( m = 3 \\). \n\nTherefore, Angela delivers 3 meals.\n#### 3"}
{"question": "Keiko sent 111 text messages last week. This week she sent 50 less than double what she sent last week. How many text messages did Keiko send last week and this week combined?", "answer": "Let \\( T_A \\) represent the number of text messages Keiko sent last week, and \\( T_B \\) represent the number of text messages she sent this week. The total number of text messages \\( T_T \\) sent last week and this week combined is given by:\n\n\\[ T_T = T_A + T_B \\]\n\nSince Keiko sent 50 less than double the number of text messages last week, we can express \\( T_B \\) as \\( 2T_A - 50 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T_T = T_A + (2T_A - 50) \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ T_T = 3T_A - 50 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of text messages sent last week and this week combined (\\( T_T \\)) is three times the number of text messages sent last week (\\( T_A \\)) minus 50.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T_A = 111 \\) texts (text messages sent last week)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ T_T = 3 \\times 111 - 50 \\]\n\\[ T_T = 333 - 50 \\]\n\\[ T_T = 283 \\]\n\nTherefore, Keiko sent a total of 283 text messages last week and this week combined.\n####\n283"}

How much does the discounted subscription cost if a subscription normally costs $80?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) be the original price of the subscription and \\( D \\) be the discount percentage. The equation to calculate the discounted subscription price \\( S \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ S = P - \\frac{D}{100} \\times P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the discounted subscription price \\( S \\) is the original price \\( P \\) minus the discount percentage \\( \\frac{D}{100} \\) multiplied by the original price \\( P \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 80 \\) dollars (original price of the subscription)\n- \\( D = 45 \\) percent (discount percentage)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 80 - \\frac{45}{100} \\times 80 \\]\n\\[ S = 80 - 0.45 \\times 80 \\]\n\\[ S = 80 - 36 \\]\n\\[ S = 44 \\]\n\nTherefore, the discounted subscription costs $44. \n#### \n44"}
