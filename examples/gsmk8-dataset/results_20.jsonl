{"question": "Nida has 50 chocolates in which some are in 3 filled boxes and 5 pieces are not in a box. Her friend brought 25 pieces of chocolates. If all chocolates must be placed in a box, how many more boxes do they need?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) be the total number of chocolates, \\( F \\) be the number of chocolates in each filled box, and \\( B \\) be the number of additional boxes needed. The equation to find the number of additional boxes needed is given by:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{{C - F}}{{F}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of additional boxes needed (\\( B \\)) is equal to the difference between the total number of chocolates (\\( C \\)) and the number of chocolates in each filled box (\\( F \\)), divided by the number of chocolates in each filled box (\\( F \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 50 \\) chocolates\n- \\( F = \\frac{{C - 5}}{{3}} = \\frac{{50 - 5}}{{3}} = 15 \\) chocolates (chocolates in each filled box)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{{50 - 15}}{{15}} \\]\n\\[ B = \\frac{{35}}{{15}} \\]\n\\[ B = 2.33 \\]\n\nTherefore, they need 2 additional boxes for the chocolates.####\n2"}
{"question": "There are 24 students in the class. One-third had their school portraits taken before lunch. After lunch, but before gym class, 10 additional students had their portraits taken.
