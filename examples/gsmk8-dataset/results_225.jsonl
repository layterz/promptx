{"question": "Bob grew corn in his garden and is ready to harvest it. He has 5 rows of corn, and each row has 80 corn stalks. About every 8 corn stalks will produce a bushel of corn. How many bushels of corn will Bob harvest?", "answer": "Let \\( R \\) represent the number of rows of corn, \\( S_R \\) represent the number of stalks per row, \\( S \\) represent the total number of corn stalks, and \\( B \\) represent the total number of bushels of corn. \n\nThe total number of corn stalks \\( S \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ S = R \\times S_R \\]\n\nSince every 8 corn stalks will produce a bushel of corn, we can express the number of bushels \\( B \\) as:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{S}{8} \\]\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{R \\times S_R}{8} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of bushels of corn (\\( B \\)) is given by the product of the number of rows of corn (\\( R \\)) and the number of corn stalks per row (\\( S_R \\)), divided by 8.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( R = 5 \\) rows (number of rows of corn)\n- \\( S_R = 80 \\) stalks per row (number of corn stalks per row)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{5 \\times 80}{8} \\]\n\\[ B = \\frac{400}{8} \\]\n\\[ B = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bob will harvest 50 bushels of corn.####\n50"}
