{"question": "Ruth is counting the number of spots on her cow. The cow has 16 spots on its left side and three times that number plus 7 on its right side. How many spots does it have total?", "answer": "Let \\( L \\) represent the number of spots on the left side of the cow, and \\( R \\) represent the number of spots on the right side of the cow. The total number of spots \\( T \\) on the cow is given by:\n\n\\[ T = L + R \\]\n\nGiven that the cow has 16 spots on its left side and three times that number plus 7 on its right side, we can express the number of spots on the right side as \\( 3L + 7 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = L + 3L + 7 \\]\n\\[ T = 4L + 7 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of spots on the cow (\\( T \\)) is four times the number of spots on the left side (\\( L \\)), plus 7.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( L = 16 \\) spots (spots on the left side)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 4 \\times 16 + 7 \\]\n\\[ T = 64 + 7 \\]\n\\[ T = 71 \\]\n\nTherefore, the cow has a total of 71 spots.\n####\n71"}
