How much will Neil charge?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of boxwoods, \\( C \\) represent the cost per boxwood to trim, \\( S \\) represent the number of boxwoods to be shaped into spheres, and \\( F \\) represent the cost per boxwood to shape into a fancy shape.\n\nThe total cost \\( C_T \\) charged by Neil is given by:\n\n\\[ C_T = (T - S) \\times C + S \\times F \\] \n\nThis equation states that the total cost charged is equal to the cost per boxwood to trim multiplied by the number of boxwoods to be trimmed, plus the cost per boxwood to shape into a fancy shape multiplied by the number of boxwoods to be shaped.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 30 \\) (total number of boxwoods)\n- \\( C = \\$5.00 \\) (cost per boxwood to trim)\n- \\( S = 4 \\) (number of boxwoods to be shaped into spheres)\n- \\( F = \\$15.00 \\) (cost per boxwood to shape into a fancy shape)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_T = (30 - 4) \\times \\$5.00 + 4 \\times \\$15.00 \\]\n\\[ C_T = 26 \\times \\$5.00 + 4 \\times \\$15.00 \\]\n\\[ C_T = \\$130.00 + \\$60.00 \\]\n\\[ C_T = \\$190.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Neil will charge a total of $190.00. \n####\n190"}
