{"question": "Drew is reseeding his lawn with grass seed. One bag of grass seed covers 250 square feet of lawn. His lawn is 22 feet from the house to the curb and 36 feet from side to side. He bought four bags of seed. How many extra square feet could the leftover grass seed cover after Drew reseeds his lawn?", "answer": "Let \\( L \\) represent the total area of Drew's lawn, and \\( A \\) represent the area covered by one bag of grass seed. The total area covered by the grass seed \\( T_A \\) can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags of seed \\( N \\) with the area covered by one bag of seed:\n\n\\[ T_A = A \\times N \\]\n\nThe area leftover \\( L_O \\) after reseeding the lawn can be calculated by subtracting the total area covered by the grass seed \\( T_A \\) from the total area of Drew's lawn \\( L \\):\n\n\\[ L_O = L - T_A \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Drew's lawn is \\( 22 \\times 36 = 792 \\) square feet (total area of Drew's lawn)\n- He bought enough grass seed to cover \\( 250 \\times 4 = 1000 \\) square feet (area covered by the grass seed)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ L_O = 792 - 1000 \\]\n\\[ L_O = -208 \\]\n\nTherefore, there will be -208 square feet leftover after Drew reseeds his lawn."}
{"question": "Aubrey is planting tomatoes and cucumbers in her garden. For each row of tomato plants, she is planting 2 rows of cucumbers. She has enough room for 15 rows of plants in total. There is enough space for 8 tomato plants in each row. If each plant produces 3 tomatoes, how many tomatoes will she have in total?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of tomato plants, \\( C \\) represent the total number of cucumber rows, and \\( R \\) represent the total number of rows of plants. \n\nGiven:\n- \\( R = 15 \\) (total rows of plants)\n- \\( T = 8 \\) (tomato plants per row)\n- \\( C = 2T = 2(8) = 16 \\) (cucumber rows per tomato row)\n\nTo find the total number of tomato plants \\( T_T \\), we need to determine the number of tomato rows \\( R_T \\). Since one out of every 3 rows will contain tomato plants, the equation is:\n\n\\[ R_T = \frac{R}{3} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ R_T = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \\]\n\nTherefore, there will be 5 rows of tomato plants.\n\nNext, we find the total number of tomato plants \\( T_T \\) by multiplying the number of tomato rows \\( R_T \\) by the tomato plants per row \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ T_T = R_T \\times T = 5 \\times 8 = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, there will be 40 tomato plants.\n\nEach tomato plant produces 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes \\( T_{total} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T_{total} = T_T \\times 3 = 40 \\times 3 = 120 \\]\n\nTherefore, Aubrey will have a total of 120 tomatoes. \n####\n120"}
{"question": "Kameron has 100 kangaroos on his large farm; Bert has 20 kangaroos on his farm.

The total number of citizens \\( T \\) in the town can be found using the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \frac{P}{0.6} \\]\n\nSince half of the pet-owners own a cat, we can express \\( C \\) as \\( \frac{1}{2} P \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = \frac{P}{0.6} \\]\n\\[ T = \frac{1}{2} P + P \\]\n\\[ T = 1.5P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of citizens in the town (\\( T \\)) is one and a half times the number of pet-owners (\\( P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 30 \\) (number of pet-owners who own a cat)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 1.5 \times 30 \\]\n\\[ T = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the town has a total of 45 citizens.\n####\n45"}
