{"question": "If there are four times as many red crayons as blue crayons in a box, and there are 3 blue crayons.  How many crayons total are in the box?", "answer": "Let \\( R \\) represent the number of red crayons and \\( B \\) represent the number of blue crayons in the box. \n\nWe are given that there are four times as many red crayons as blue crayons, so we can express \\( R \\) in terms of \\( B \\) as \\( R = 4B \\). \n\nWe are also given that there are 3 blue crayons, so \\( B = 3 \\). \n\nSubstituting the value of \\( B \\) into the equation \\( R = 4B \\), we get \\( R = 4(3) = 12 \\). \n\nThe total number of crayons in the box can be found by adding the number of red crayons and the number of blue crayons: \n\n\\( \\text{Total crayons} = R + B = 12 + 3 = 15 \\). \n\nTherefore, there are 15 crayons total in the box. \n#### 15"}
