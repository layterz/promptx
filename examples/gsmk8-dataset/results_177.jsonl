{"question": "There is a lot of dust in Susie's house. It takes her 2 hours to vacuum the whole house. She can vacuum each room in 20 minutes. How many rooms does she have in her house?", "answer": "Let \\( R \\) represent the number of rooms in Susie's house. Given that she spends 2 hours vacuuming the whole house and she can vacuum each room in 20 minutes, we can create the following equation:\n\n\\[ 120 = 20R \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total time spent vacuuming (120 minutes) is equal to the time spent vacuuming each room (20 minutes) multiplied by the number of rooms (\\( R \\)).\n\nSolving for \\( R \\):\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{120}{20} \\]\n\\[ R = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, Susie has 6 rooms in her house.\n####\n6"}
