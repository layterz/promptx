{"question": "Granger went to the grocery store. He saw that the Spam is $3 per can, the peanut butter is $5 per jar, and the bread is $2 per loaf. If he bought 12 cans of spam, 3 jars of peanut butter, and 4 loaves of bread, how much is the total amount he paid?", "answer": "Let \\( C_S \\) represent the cost of each can of Spam, \\( N_S \\) represent the number of cans of Spam, \\( C_P \\) represent the cost of each jar of peanut butter, \\( N_P \\) represent the number of jars of peanut butter, \\( C_B \\) represent the cost of each loaf of bread, and \\( N_B \\) represent the number of loaves of bread. The total amount \\( T \\) Granger paid is given by:\n\n\\[ T = (C_S \\times N_S) + (C_P \\times N_P) + (C_B \\times N_B) \\]\n\nSince Granger bought 12 cans of Spam, 3 jars of peanut butter, and 4 loaves of bread, we can substitute the values into the equation:\n\n\\[ T = (3 \\times 12) + (5 \\times 3) + (2 \\times 4) \\]\n\\[ T = 36 + 15 + 8 \\]\n\\[ T = 59 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount Granger paid is $59.\n#### 59"}
{"question": "On Monday, Sydney sends 5 texts each to Allison and Brittney. On Tuesday, she sends 15 texts to each of them.

Since Sydney sends 5 texts to each of them, we can express this as \\( T_A + T_B = 5 \\times 2 \\).\n\nThe total number of texts sent by Sydney on Tuesday is also given by \\( T_A + T_B \\). Since Sydney sends 15 texts to each of them, we can express this as \\( T_A + T_B = 15 \\times 2 \\).\n\nThe total number of texts Sydney sends to Allison and Brittney on both days (\\( T_T \\)) is the sum of the texts sent on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, we can write the equation as:\n\n\\[ T_T = (T_A + T_B) + (T_A + T_B) \\]\n\\[ T_T = 2(T_A + T_B) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of texts sent by Sydney to Allison and Brittney on both days (\\( T_T \\)) is twice the sum of the texts sent to each of them (\\( T_A + T_B \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T_A = 5 \\) texts (texts sent to Allison)\n- \\( T_B = 5 \\) texts (texts sent to Brittney)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T_T = 2(5 + 5) \\]\n\\[ T_T = 2 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ T_T = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, Sydney sends a total of 20 texts to Allison and Brittney on both Monday and Tuesday.\n####\n20"}

{"question": "A farmer is growing corn. For every 4 seeds he plants, he gets one ear of corn, that he can sell for $.1. It costs $.5 for a bag with 100 seeds.

Number of ears of corn:\n    For every 4 seeds planted, the farmer gets one ear of corn. Therefore, the number of ears of corn (\\( E \\)) is calculated by dividing the number of seeds planted (\\( N \\)) by 4:\n    \\[ E = \\frac{{N}}{{4}} \\]\n    \n3. Profit per ear of corn:\n    The farmer sells each ear of corn for \\$0.1. It costs \\$0.02 to grow an ear of corn, so the profit per ear of corn is the selling price minus the cost to grow one ear:\n    \\[ \\text{{Profit per ear}} = \\text{{Selling price}} - \\text{{Cost to grow one ear}} \\]\n    \\[ \\text{{Profit per ear}} = 0.1 - 0.02 \\]\n    \\[ \\text{{Profit per ear}} = 0.08 \\]\n    Therefore, the profit per ear of corn is \\$0.08.\n    \n4.
