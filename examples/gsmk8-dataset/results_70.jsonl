{"question": "Mr. Mitchell is buying pizzas for the soccer team. He buys one slice for every goal they scored on the season. A large pizza has 12 slices. If he bought 6 pizzas, and the team had 8 games, how many goals did they score per game on average?", "answer": "Let \\( G \\) represent the number of goals scored by the soccer team, \\( P \\) represent the number of pizzas bought, and \\( S \\) represent the number of slices per pizza. \n\nThe total number of goals scored by the team is given by:\n\n\\[ G = P \\times S \\]\n\nSince each pizza has 12 slices, we can express \\( S \\) as 12. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ G = P \\times 12 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of goals scored (\\( G \\)) is the product of the number of pizzas bought (\\( P \\)) and the number of slices per pizza (12).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 6 \\) pizzas (number of pizzas bought)\n- \\( S = 12 \\) slices (number of slices per pizza)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ G = 6 \\times 12 \\]\n\\[ G = 72 \\]\n\nTherefore, the soccer team scored a total of 72 goals.\n\nTo find the average number of goals scored per game, we divide the total number of goals by the number of games played:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average goals per game} = \\frac{G}{\\text{number of games}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Number of games = 8\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average goals per game} = \\frac{72}{8} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Average goals per game} = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, the soccer team scored an average of 9 goals per game.####\n9"}
{"question": "The Giants baseball team is trying to make their league playoff. They have played 20 games and won 12 of them. To make the playoffs, they need to win 2/3 of their games over the season. If there are 10 games left, how many do they have to win to make the playoffs?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of games, \\( W \\) represent the number of games won, and \\( L \\) represent the number of games lost. To make the playoffs, the Giants baseball team needs to win \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of their games over the season. \n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 20 + 10 = 30 \\) (total number of games)\n- \\( W = 12 \\) (number of games won)\n\nTo find the number of games \\( G \\) they need to win to make the playoffs, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{W + G}{T} \\geq \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{12 + G}{30} \\geq \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( G \\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 30:\n\n\\[ 12 + G \\geq \\frac{2}{3} \\times 30 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ 12 + G \\geq 20 \\]\n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides:\n\n\\[ G \\geq 20 - 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Giants baseball team needs to win at least 8 more games to make the playoffs. \n\n#### 8"}
{"question": "Emily just purchased 2 pairs of curtains for $30.00 each and 9 wall prints at $15.00 each.  The store also offers an installation service.  For $50.00 they will come to your house and professionally hang your curtains and prints.  If Emily agrees to this service, how much will her entire order cost?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the cost of the curtains, \\( P \\) represent the cost of the wall prints, and \\( I \\) represent the cost of the installation service. The total cost of Emily's entire order \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = C + P + I \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Emily buys 2 pairs of curtains for $30.00 each, so \\( C = 2 \\times 30 = $60.00 \\)\n- Emily buys 9 wall prints at $15.00 each, so \\( P = 9 \\times 15 = $135.00 \\)\n- The installation service costs $50.00, so \\( I = $50.00 \\)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 60 + 135 + 50 \\]\n\\[ T = $245.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Emily's entire order will cost $245.00.\n####\n245"}
{"question": "Faith's neighborhood, with a total of 20 homes, decided to install solar panels. Each home needed 10 panels capable of providing their power needs.
