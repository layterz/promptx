{"question": "Rockefeller Army Base has 3000 more than twice as many guns as Grenada Army Base, 400 less than thrice as many war tractors as Grenada Army Base, and 30 times as many soldier uniforms as Grenada Army Base reserved for its national protection. How many total war supplies does Rockefeller have if Grenada's war supplies are equally divided among the 6000 war supplies they have in total?", "answer": "Let \\( G \\) represent the number of war supplies at Grenada Army Base, \\( R \\) represent the number of war supplies at Rockefeller Army Base, \\( G_G \\) represent the number of guns at Grenada Army Base, \\( G_W \\) represent the number of war tractors at Grenada Army Base, and \\( G_S \\) represent the number of soldier uniforms at Grenada Army Base. The equation to find the total number of war supplies at Rockefeller Army Base \\( R_T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ R_T =  G_G + G_W + G_S \\]\n\nGiven that Grenada's war supplies are equally divided among the 6000 war supplies they have in total, we have:\n\n\\[ G = \\frac{6000}{3} \\]\n\nThus, we can substitute the values of \\( G_G \\), \\( G_W \\), and \\( G_S \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ R_T =  (3000 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{6000}{3}) + (3 \\cdot \\frac{6000}{3} - 400) + (30 \\cdot \\frac{6000}{3}) \\]\n\\[ R_T =  3000 + 2 \\cdot 2000 + 3 \\cdot 2000 - 400 + 30 \\cdot 2000 \\]\n\\[ R_T =  7000 + 5600 + 60000 \\]\n\\[ R_T =  72600 \\]\n\nTherefore, Rockefeller Army Base has a total of 72600 war supplies for its national protection.\n####\n72600"}
{"question": "Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda. Mara has twice as many cards as Janet. How many cards do they have in all if Mara has 40 cards less than 150?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent the number of cards Janet has, \\( B \\) represent the number of cards Brenda has, and \\( M \\) represent the number of cards Mara has. The equation to find the total number of cards in all is given by:\n\n\\[ J + B + M = (\\text{number of cards Janet has}) + (\\text{number of cards Brenda has}) + (\\text{number of cards Mara has}) \\]\n\nSince Mara has 40 cards less than 150, we can express the number of cards Mara has as \\( 150 - 40 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ J + B + M = J + B + (150 - 40) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of cards in all is the sum of the number of cards Janet has, the number of cards Brenda has, and 110 (the number of cards Mara has).\n\nGiven:\n- Mara has 150 - 40 = <<150-40=110>>110 cards\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ J + B + M = J + B + 110 \\]\n\nSince Mara has twice as many cards as Janet, we can express \\( M \\) as \\( 2J \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ J + B + 110 = J + B + 2J \\]\n\\[ J + B + 110 = 3J + B \\]\n\nSince Janet has 9 cards more than Brenda, we can express \\( J \\) as \\( B + 9 \\).
