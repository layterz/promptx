{"question": "For the gala luncheon planning committee, Margaret wants to serve chicken salad sandwiches using mini croissants.  She wants there to be enough food that each person on the committee can have 2 sandwiches each.  Her bakery offers 12 minis croissants for $8.00.  There are 24 people on the committee. How much will she spend on croissants?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the cost of the croissants, \\( N \\) represent the number of people on the committee, \\( S \\) represent the number of sandwiches per person, and \\( D \\) represent the number of dozens of croissants needed. \n\nThe equation to find the cost of the croissants is given by:\n\n\\[ C = D \\times \\text{{cost per dozen}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the cost of the croissants (\\( C \\)) is equal to the number of dozens of croissants needed (\\( D \\)) multiplied by the cost per dozen.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( N = 24 \\) people (number of people on the committee)\n- \\( S = 2 \\) sandwiches per person (number of sandwiches per person)\n\nTo calculate the number of croissants needed, we multiply the number of people by the number of sandwiches per person:\n\n\\[ \\text{{number of sandwiches}} = N \\times S \\]\n\\[ \\text{{number of sandwiches}} = 24 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{{number of sandwiches}} = 48 \\]\n\nSince a dozen contains 12 croissants, the number of dozens needed is:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{{\\text{{number of sandwiches}}}}{{\\text{{number of croissants per dozen}}}} \\]\n\\[ D = \\frac{{48}}{{12}} \\]\n\\[ D = 4 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( D \\) into the equation for the cost of the croissants:\n\n\\[ C = 4 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ C = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, Margaret will spend $32.00 on croissants. \n####\n32"}
