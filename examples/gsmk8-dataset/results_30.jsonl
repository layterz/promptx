{"question": "Jenna works as a truck driver. She gets paid $0.40 cents per mile. If she drives 400 miles one way, how much does she get paid for a round trip?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) represent the number of miles driven by Jenna and \\( P \\) represent her pay per mile. The equation to find Jenna's total pay \\( T \\) for a round trip is given by:\n\n\\[ T = M \\cdot P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total pay (\\( T \\)) is equal to the number of miles driven (\\( M \\)) multiplied by the pay per mile (\\( P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( M = 400 \\) miles (one-way distance driven)\n- \\( P = \\$0.40 \\) per mile (pay per mile)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 400 \\cdot \\$0.40 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$<<400*0.4=160>>160 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jenna gets paid \\$160 for a round trip.\n\n#### 160"}
