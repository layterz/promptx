{"question": "Nancy earns $28 for working 4 hours. How many hours does she have to work to earn $70?", "answer": "Let \\( E \\) be the amount of money Nancy earns, \\( W \\) be the number of hours Nancy works, and \\( R \\) be the rate of earning per hour. The equation to find the number of hours \\( H \\) Nancy has to work to earn a specific amount of money is given by:\n\n\\[ E = R \\cdot H \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount of money earned (\\( E \\)) is the rate of earning per hour (\\( R \\)) multiplied by the number of hours worked (\\( H \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( E = \\$70 \\) (desired amount of money to earn)\n- \\( R = \\$7 \\) per hour (earning rate per hour)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ \\$70 = \\$7 \\cdot H \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( H \\), we can divide both sides of the equation by \\$7:\n\n\\[ \\frac{{\\$70}}{{\\$7}} = H \\]\n\\[ 10 = H \\]\n\nTherefore, Nancy has to work 10 hours to earn \\$70.\n####\n10"}
{"question": "Going into the final game, Duke is so close to breaking the school's record for most points scored in a basketball season. He only needs 17 more points to tie the record. By the end of the game, Duke breaks the record by 5 points. The old record was 257 points. In the final game Duke made 5 free throws (worth one point), and 4 regular baskets (worth two points), and some three-pointers. Normally, he scores 2 three-pointers a game.
