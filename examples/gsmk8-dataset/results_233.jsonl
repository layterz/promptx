{"question": "Nadia is learning to play the piano. She normally makes 3 mistakes per 40 notes and can play about 60 notes a minute.   If she plays for 8 minutes how many mistakes will she make on average?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) represent the total number of notes played, \\( M \\) represent the total number of mistakes made, and \\( B \\) represent the number of blocks of 40 notes played. The relationship between these variables can be expressed as follows:\n\n\\[ N = B \\times 40 \\]\n\n\\[ M = B \\times 3 \\]\n\nWe know that Nadia can play about 60 notes in a minute and she plays for 8 minutes. Therefore, the total number of notes played (\\( N \\)) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ N = 60 \\times 8 \\]\n\nApplying this value to the equation, we can solve for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ N = B \\times 40 \\]\n\n\\[ 60 \\times 8 = B \\times 40 \\]\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{60 \\times 8}{40} \\]\n\nNow we can calculate \\( M \\) by substituting the value of \\( B \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ M = B \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{60 \\times 8}{40} \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{480}{40} \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ M = 12 \\times 3 \\]\n\n\\[ M = 36 \\]\n\nTherefore, Nadia will make an average of 36 mistakes when playing the piano for 8 minutes. \n#### 36"}
