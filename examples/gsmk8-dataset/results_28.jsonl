{"question": "Wally gives 3/4 of his 400 tickets to his two friends Jensen and Finley, who share the tickets in a ratio of 4:11. How many tickets does Finley get?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of tickets that Wally gives to his friends, \\( R \\) represent the total ratio that represents the tickets that Jensen and Finley share, and \\( F \\) represent the fraction that represents the share that Finley got.\n\nThe equation to find the number of tickets \\( T_f \\) that Finley gets is given by:\n\n\\[ T_f = F \\times T \\]\n\nGiven that Wally gives 3/4 of his 400 tickets to share, then\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 400 \\]\n\\[ T = 300 \\]\n\nThe total ratio that represents the tickets that Jensen and Finley share is given as 4:11, which means the total ratio \\( R = 4 + 11 = 15 \\).\n\nFrom the total ratio, the fraction that represents the share that Finley got is 11/15. Therefore,\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{11}{15} \\]\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T_f = \\frac{11}{15} \\times 300 \\]\n\\[ T_f = \\frac{11}{5} \\times 60 \\]\n\\[ T_f = 220 \\]\n\nTherefore, Finley gets 220 tickets. \n####\n220"}
