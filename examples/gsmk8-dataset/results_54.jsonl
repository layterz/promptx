{"question": "To try to get the class to eat more vegetables, the teacher says that she will start giving them good character points that the class can redeem for a movie day if they earn enough. The students need to earn 200 points to win the movie day. Each time a student eats their vegetables at lunch she gives the student 2 points. There are 25 students in the class. If they have two school weeks, otherwise known as 10 days to win the movie, what is the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week to get a movie day?", "answer": "Let \\( V \\) be the average number of vegetables each student must eat per school week.\n\nThe total number of vegetables the students need to eat to win the movie day is given by:\n\n\\[ 200 \\text{ points} = 2 \\text{ points} \\times \\text{Number of Vegetables} \\]\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Vegetables} = \\frac{200}{2} \\]\n\nLet \\( N \\) be the total number of students in the class.\n\nThe average number of vegetables each student needs to eat is given by:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{\\text{Number of Vegetables}}{N} \\]\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{100}{25} \\]\n\nLet \\( D \\) be the number of school weeks.\n\nThe number of vegetables each student needs to eat per school week is given by:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{per school week}} = \\frac{V}{D} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values, we have:\n\n\\[ V_{\\text{per school week}} = \\frac{4}{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, each student needs to eat 2 vegetables per school week on average to win the movie day.\n####\n2"}
{"question": "A crate can hold 20 kilograms of tomatoes. Tommy has 3 crates which he bought for $330. He wants to sell the tomatoes for $6 per 1 kilogram but 3 kilograms of tomatoes were rotten. How much will be Tommy's profit from selling those tomatoes?", "answer": "To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total weight of tomatoes Tommy has. Let \\(W\\) represent the total weight of tomatoes. We know that each crate can hold 20 kilograms of tomatoes, and Tommy has 3 crates. So the equation becomes:\n\n   \\[W = 20 \\times 3\\]\n\n2. Determine the weight of tomatoes that can be sold. Since 3 kilograms of tomatoes were rotten and cannot be sold, we subtract 3 from the total weight:\n\n   \\[W_{\\text{sold}} = W - 3\\]\n\n3. Calculate the earnings from selling the tomatoes. We know that Tommy wants to sell the tomatoes at a price of $6 per 1 kilogram. So the equation becomes:\n\n   \\[\\text{earnings} = W_{\\text{sold}} \\times 6\\]\n\n4. Calculate Tommy's profit by subtracting the cost of buying the crates from the earnings:\n\n   \\[\\text{profit} = \\text{earnings} - \\$330\\]\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n1. \\(W = 20 \\times 3\\)\n2. \\(W_{\\text{sold}} = 60 - 3\\)\n3. \\(\\text{earnings} = (60 - 3) \\times 6\\)\n4. \\(\\text{profit} = (57 \\times 6) - \\$330\\)\n\nThus, Tommy's profit from selling the tomatoes is $12.\n\n#### 12"}
