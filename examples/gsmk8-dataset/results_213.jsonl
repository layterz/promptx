{"question": "Mary wants to ride the world's tallest roller coaster, Kingda Ka. The minimum height to ride the roller coaster is 140 cm. Mary's brother is 180 cm, Mary is 2/3 the height of her brother. How many more centimeters does Mary need to grow to ride Kingda Ka?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the height of Mary's brother, and \\( M \\) represent Mary's height. The equation to find how many more centimeters Mary needs to grow to reach the minimum height to ride Kingda Ka is given by:\n\n\\[ 140 - M = B - M \\]\n\nThis equation states that the difference between the minimum height (140 cm) and Mary's height (\\( M \\)) is equal to the difference between Mary's brother's height (\\( B \\)) and Mary's height (\\( M \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 180 \\) cm (height of Mary's brother)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ 140 - M = 180 - M \\]\n\\[ M = 180 - 140 \\]\n\\[ M = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mary needs to grow 20 cm more to reach the minimum height and ride Kingda Ka.\n####\n20"}
{"question": "Lizzy had $30. She loaned out $15 to her friend.

The total number of fish \\( T \\) caught by both Jordan and Perry is given by:\n\n\\[ T = J + P \\]\n\nSince Perry caught double what Jordan caught, we can express \\( P \\) as \\( 2J \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = J + 2J \\]\n\\[ T = 3J \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of fish caught (\\( T \\)) is three times the number of fish Jordan caught (\\( J \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J = 4 \\) fish (number of fish caught by Jordan)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 3 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ T = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jordan and Perry caught a total of 12 fish.\n\nHowever, on the way back to the shore, they lost one-fourth of their total catch.
