{"question": "The total average age of three friends is 40. Jared is ten years older than Hakimi, and Molly's age is 30. How old is Hakimi?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) be the total average age of three friends, \\( M \\) be Molly's age, \\( J \\) be Jared's age, and \\( H \\) be Hakimi's age. The equation to find Hakimi's age \\( H \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{M + J + H}{3} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total average age \\( T \\) is equal to the sum of Molly's age \\( M \\), Jared's age \\( J \\), and Hakimi's age \\( H \\), divided by 3.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 40 \\) (total average age of three friends)\n- \\( M = 30 \\) (Molly's age)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 40 = \\frac{30 + J + H}{3} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ 120 = 30 + J + H \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ J + H = 90 \\]\n\nSince Jared is 10 years older than Hakimi, we can express Jared's age as \\( H + 10 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ H + (H + 10) = 90 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 2H + 10 = 90 \\]\n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 2H = 80 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ H = \\frac{80}{2} \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ H = 40 \\]\n\nTherefore, Hakimi's age is 40. ####\n40"}
{"question": "Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell?", "answer": "Let \\( s \\) be the number of times the small bell rings, and \\( b \\) be the number of times the big bell rings. We know that \\( s + b = 52 \\) and \\( s = 4 + \\frac{1}{3}b \\).\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get \\( 4 + \\frac{1}{3}b + b = 52 \\).\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides, we get \\( \\frac{1}{3}b + b = 48 \\).\n\nCombining like terms, we get \\( \\frac{4}{3}b = 48 \\).\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{4}{3} \\), we get \\( b = 36 \\).\n\nTherefore, Martin rings the big bell 36 times.####\n36"}
{"question": "Sabrina is collecting herbs to make a poultice for her grandmother. She needs twice as many basil leaves as sage leaves and 5 fewer sage leaves than verbena leaves.
