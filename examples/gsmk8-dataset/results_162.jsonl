{"question": "Janet counts 30 crows on the powerlines and 60% more hawks than crows. How many birds does she count total?", "answer": "Given the prompt, let's define the following variables:\n- \\( C \\) = number of crows\n- \\( H \\) = number of hawks\n\nWe are given that there are 30 crows on the powerlines. We are also given that there are 60% more hawks than crows. Therefore, we can represent the number of hawks in terms of the number of crows as \\( 1.6C \\) (since 60% of C is equal to 1.6C).\n\nTo find the total number of birds, we can add the number of crows and the number of hawks, which gives us the equation:\n\\[ C + 1.6C \\]\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\\[ 2.6C \\]\n\nSince we know that C is 30, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\\[ 2.6 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ 78 \\]\n\nTherefore, Janet counts a total of 78 birds. \n#### 78"}
{"question": "Joan has 180 socks. Two thirds of the socks are white, and the rest of the socks are blue. How many blue socks does Joan have?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of socks, \\( W \\) represent the number of white socks, and \\( B \\) represent the number of blue socks. The equation to find the number of blue socks \\( B \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ B = T - W \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of blue socks (\\( B \\)) is equal to the total number of socks (\\( T \\)) minus the number of white socks (\\( W \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 180 \\) socks (total number of socks)\n- \\( W = \\frac{2}{3}T = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 180 = 120 \\) socks (number of white socks)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ B = 180 - 120 \\]\n\\[ B = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, Joan has 60 blue socks. \n####\n60"}
{"question": "Simon collected treasures on the beach during his summer vacation. He collected a bucket of pearly seashells, a jar full of smooth sea glass, and a bag of ten sand dollars. If the jar holds three times as many pieces of glass as the bag does sand dollars, and the bucket holds five times as many seashells as the jar holds pieces of glass, how many treasures did Simon find on the beach?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the number of seashells in the bucket, \\( J \\) represent the number of pieces of glass in the jar, and \\( D \\) represent the number of sand dollars in the bag. The total number of treasures \\( T \\) that Simon found on the beach is given by:\n\n\\[ T = B + J + D \\]\n\nGiven:\n- The jar holds three times as many pieces of glass as the bag holds sand dollars, so \\( J = 3D \\)\n- The bucket holds five times as many seashells as the jar holds pieces of glass, so \\( B = 5J \\)\n\nApplying the given values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = B + J + D \\]\n\\[ T = (5J) + J + D \\]\n\\[ T = 6J + D \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( J = 3D \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 6(3D) + D \\]\n\\[ T = 18D + D \\]\n\\[ T = 19D \\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of treasures that Simon found on the beach is 19 times the number of sand dollars in the bag.\n####\n190"}
