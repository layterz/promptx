{"question": "Jack needs to put his shoes on, then help both his toddlers tie their shoes. If it takes Jack 4 minutes to put his shoes on, and three minutes longer to help each toddler with their shoes, how long does it take them to get ready?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total time taken to get ready, \\( T_J \\) represent the time Jack takes to put his shoes on, \\( T_{\\text{toddler}} \\) represent the time spent helping each toddler tie their shoes, and \\( N \\) represent the number of toddlers.\n\nThe equation to find the total time \\( T \\) taken to get ready is given by:\n\n\\[ T = T_J + N \\times T_{\\text{toddler}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total time \\( T \\) is the sum of the time Jack takes to put his shoes on (\\( T_J \\)) and the time spent helping each toddler (\\( T_{\\text{toddler}} \\)) multiplied by the number of toddlers (\\( N \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T_J = 4 \\) minutes (time taken by Jack to put his shoes on)\n- \\( T_{\\text{toddler}} = 4 + 3 \\) minutes (time taken to help each toddler with their shoes, assuming it takes 3 minutes longer than Jack)\n- \\( N = 2 \\) toddlers (number of toddlers)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 4 + 2 \\times (4 + 3) \\]\n\\[ T = 4 + 2 \\times 7 \\]\n\\[ T = 4 + 14 \\]\n\\[ T = 18 \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes them a total of 18 minutes to get ready.\n####\n18"}

{"question": "Alec is running for Class President. He thinks that if he can get three-quarters of the class to vote for him then there is no chance anyone else can beat him. Half of the class have already said they will vote for him but out of the remaining students, only 5 have said they are thinking about voting for him. He surveys the students who are thinking about voting for someone else, and changes his flyers to reflect the issues these students are concerned about. This results in a fifth of these students saying they'll vote for him. If Alec's class has 60 students and everyone who said they will vote for him does so, how many more votes does Alec need to reach his goal number of votes?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the total number of students in Alec's class.

Let's calculate \\( V_h \\):\n\n\\[ V_h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\]\n\\[ V_h = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, 30 students have already said they will vote for Alec.\n\nNext, we are given that \\( V_t \\) students are thinking about voting for Alec.

{"question": "The garbage truck passes through Daniel's neighborhood on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. In each garbage collection, an average of 200 kg is taken. Due to obstruction in the roads leading to Daniel's neighborhood, the garbage truck stops passing through for two weeks.

If Greg spent 9 more than twice as much on shoes as he did a shirt, how much did Greg spend on a shirt?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the amount spent on a shirt, and \\( SH \\) represent the amount spent on shoes. The equation to find the amount spent on a shirt \\( S \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ S = 300 - SH \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount spent on a shirt (\\( S \\)) is equal to the total amount spent on both items (\\$300) minus the amount spent on shoes (\\( SH \\)).\n\nSince Greg spent 9 more than twice as much on shoes as he did on a shirt, we can express \\( SH \\) in terms of \\( S \\) as \\( 2S + 9 \\).
