{"question": "Jane bought pens for her three students. Each student received 62 red pens and 43 black pens. They pooled their pens together and took them from the pool whenever they needed them. After the first month, they had taken a total of 37 pens from the pool. After the second month, they had taken another 41 pens from the pool. Then Jane decided to split the remaining pens equally among them. How many pens will each student get now?", "answer": "Let \\( P_r \\) be the number of pens each student receives after they split the remaining pens equally.\n\nGiven:\n- Each student started with 62 red pens and 43 black pens, so they each received \\( 62 + 43 = 105 \\) pens.\n- They pooled their pens together and had a total of \\( 105 \\times 3 = 315 \\) pens in the pool.\n- They took 37 pens from the pool in the first month, leaving \\( 315 - 37 = 278 \\) pens remaining in the pool.\n- They took another 41 pens from the pool in the second month, leaving \\( 278 - 41 = 237 \\) pens remaining in the pool.\n\nTo determine how many pens each student receives after splitting the remaining pens equally, we divide the number of pens in the pool by the number of students:\n\n\\[ P_r = \\frac{237}{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, each student will receive 79 pens now.\n####\n79"}
{"question": "Hasan is packing up his apartment because he\u2019s moving across the country for a new job. He needs to ship several boxes to his new home. The movers have asked that Hasan avoid putting more than a certain weight in pounds in any cardboard box. The moving company has helpfully provided Hasan with a digital scale that will alert him if a package is too heavy. Hasan is in the kitchen, and he fills a cardboard box with 38 dinner plates. When he checks the box, the scale reports his box is too heavy. Hasan knows each of his plates weighs 10 ounces. He removes a single plate from the box and checks the movers\u2019 scale again. The scale reports his box is still too heavy. Hasan repeats the process again and again. When he has removed enough plates, the movers\u2019 scale shows the box is now an acceptable weight for shipping. Hasan deduces that each shipping box can hold 20 pounds before the scale says the box is too heavy.  How many plates did Hasan need to remove from the shipping box?", "answer": "Let \\( x \\) be the number of plates removed from the box.\n\nHasan figured out the movers' weight limit was 20 pounds. Since a pound is equal to 16 ounces, each box can hold \\( 20 \\times 16 \\), or 320 ounces.\n\nEach plate weighs 10 ounces, so the weight of the plates in the box after Hasan removes enough plates to satisfy the movers' weight limit is \\( (38 - x) \\times 10 \\) ounces.\n\nSince these two values are equal, we can write the equation \\( (38 - x) \\times 10 = 320 \\).\n\nDividing both sides by 10 leaves \\( 38 - x = 32 \\).\n\nAdding \\( x \\) to both sides gives \\( 38 \u2013 x + x = 32 + x \\), or \\( 38 = 32 + x \\).\n\nSubtracting 32 from both sides gives the value of \\( x \\), which is the number of plates removed from the box, \\( 38 - 32 = 32 + x \u2013 32 \\), or \\( 6 = x \\).\n\nTherefore, Hasan needed to remove 6 plates from the shipping box.\n####\n6"}
{"question": "Nancy and Jason are learning to dance for the first time. Nancy steps on her partner's feet 3 times as often as Jason. If together they step on each other's feet 32 times, how many times does Jason step on his partner's feet?", "answer": "Let \\( n \\) be the number of times Nancy steps on her partner's feet and \\( j \\) be the number of times Jason does. We know that \\( n = 3j \\) and \\( n + j = 32 \\).\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get \\( 3j + j = 32 \\).\n\nCombining like terms, we get \\( 4j = 32 \\).\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get \\( j = 8 \\).\n\nTherefore, Jason steps on his partner's feet 8 times.\n####\n8"}
