{"question": "Last week, a farmer shipped 10 boxes of pomelos which had 240 pomelos in all. This week, the farmer shipped 20 boxes. How many dozens of pomelos did the farmer ship in all?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) be the total number of pomelos, \\( B \\) be the total number of boxes, and \\( D_B \\) be the number of dozens of pomelos in each box. The equation to find the total number of dozens of pomelos \\( D_T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ D_T = B \\times D_B \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of dozens of pomelos (\\( D_T \\)) is equal to the number of boxes (\\( B \\)) multiplied by the number of dozens of pomelos in each box (\\( D_B \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 10 \\) boxes (boxes of pomelos last week)\n- \\( D_B = \\frac{240}{10} = 24 \\) pomelos per box (24 pomelos in each box)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ D_T = 10 \\times 24 \\]\n\\[ D_T = 240 \\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer shipped a total of 240 dozens of pomelos last week.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 20 \\) boxes (boxes of pomelos this week)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ D_T = 20 \\times 24 \\]\n\\[ D_T = 480 \\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer shipped a total of 480 dozens of pomelos this week.\n\nSo, the farmer shipped a total of 240 + 480 = 720 dozens of pomelos in all.\n####\n720"}
