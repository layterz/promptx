{"question": "It takes 5 people to lift a car and twice as many people to lift a truck. How many people are needed to lift 6 cars and 3 trucks?", "answer": "Let \\(C\\) represent the number of cars and \\(T\\) represent the number of trucks. It is given that it takes 5 people to lift a car and twice as many people to lift a truck.
