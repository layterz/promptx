{"question": "Nancy carves statues out of jade. A giraffe statue takes 120 grams of jade and sells for $150. An elephant statue takes twice as much jade and sells for $350. If Nancy has 1920 grams of jade, how much more money will she make turning it all into elephants instead of giraffes?", "answer": "Let \\( G \\) represent the number of giraffe statues that Nancy can make, and \\( E \\) represent the number of elephant statues she can make. The total amount of jade \\( J_T \\) that Nancy has is 1920 grams.\n\nThe amount of jade \\( J_G \\) used for a giraffe statue is 120 grams, and the amount of jade \\( J_E \\) used for an elephant statue is twice that amount. The prices for a giraffe statue \\( P_G \\) and an elephant statue \\( P_E \\) are $150 and $350, respectively.\n\nFirst, we find the number of giraffe statues Nancy can make by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount used per giraffe statue:\n\n\\[ G = \\frac{J_T}{J_G} = \\frac{1920}{120} \\]\n\nNext, we calculate Nancy's earnings from the giraffes by multiplying the number of giraffe statues by the price per giraffe:\n\n\\[ \\text{Earnings from Giraffes} = G \\cdot P_G \\]\n\nThen, we find the amount of jade used per elephant statue by doubling the amount used by the giraffe statues:\n\n\\[ J_E = 2 \\cdot J_G \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of elephant statues Nancy can make by dividing the total amount of jade by the amount used per elephant statue:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{J_T}{J_E} = \\frac{1920}{J_E} = \\frac{1920}{2 \\cdot J_G} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate Nancy's earnings from the elephants by multiplying the number of elephant statues by the price per elephant:\n\n\\[ \\text{Earnings from Elephants} = E \\cdot P_E \\]\n\nTo find the difference in earnings, we subtract Nancy's earnings from the giraffes from her earnings from the elephants:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference in Earnings} = \\text{Earnings from Elephants} - \\text{Earnings from Giraffes} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J_T = 1920 \\) grams (total amount of jade)\n- \\( J_G = 120 \\) grams (jade used for a giraffe statue)\n- \\( P_G = 150 \\) dollars (price per giraffe statue)\n- \\( P_E = 350 \\) dollars (price per elephant statue)\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n\\[ G = \\frac{1920}{120} = 16 \\]\n\\[\\text{Earnings from Giraffes} = 16 \\cdot 150 = 2400 \\]\n\\[ J_E = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240 \\]\n\\[ E = \\frac{1920}{240} = 8 \\]\n\\[\\text{Earnings from Elephants} = 8 \\cdot 350 = 2800 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Difference in Earnings} = 2800 - 2400 = 400 \\]\n\nTherefore, Nancy will make $400 more by turning all the jade into elephants instead of giraffes.\n#### 400"}
{"question": "Lucca bought 200 pieces of bread. Lucca ate 1/4 of the pieces of bread in one day, and 2/5 of the remaining pieces the next day.

The equation to find the number of pieces of bread remaining (\\( B_r \\)) after the third day is given by:\n\n\\[ B_r = B - B_1 - B_2 - B_3 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of pieces of bread remaining (\\( B_r \\)) is the difference between the total number of pieces of bread (\\( B \\)) and the sum of the pieces eaten on the first day (\\( B_1 \\)), second day (\\( B_2 \\)), and third day (\\( B_3 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 200 \\) pieces (total number of pieces of bread)\n- \\( B_1 = 1/4 \\times B = 1/4 \\times 200 = 50 \\) pieces (pieces eaten on the first day)\n- \\( B_2 = 2/5 \\times (B - B_1) = 2/5 \\times (200 - 50) = 60 \\) pieces (pieces eaten on the second day, which is 2/5 of the remaining pieces after the first day)\n- \\( B_3 = 1/2 \\times (B - B_1 - B_2) = 1/2 \\times (200 - 50 - 60) = 45 \\) pieces (pieces eaten on the third day, which is half of the remaining pieces after the first and second day)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ B_r = 200 - 50 - 60 - 45 \\]\n\\[ B_r = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 45 pieces of bread remaining after the third day.\n####\n45"}
