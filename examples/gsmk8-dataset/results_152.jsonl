{"question": "Tirzah has a lot of purses and handbags; in total she has 26 purses and 24 handbags. Half the purses and 1/4 the handbags are fake. If the rest are authentic, how many purses and handbags in total are genuine?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the number of purses and \\( H \\) represent the number of handbags. The total number of purses and handbags \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = P + H \\]\n\nSince half of the purses are fake and 1/4 of the handbags are fake, we can express the number of fake purses \\( F_P \\) and fake handbags \\( F_H \\) as:\n\n\\[ F_P = \frac{1}{2} P \\]\n\\[ F_H = \frac{1}{4} H \\]\n\nThe number of genuine purses \\( G_P \\) and genuine handbags \\( G_H \\) can be found by subtracting the number of fake purses and handbags from the total number of purses and handbags:\n\n\\[ G_P = P - F_P \\]\n\\[ G_H = H - F_H \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of genuine purses and handbags \\( G \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ G = G_P + G_H \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 26 \\) purses\n- \\( H = 24 \\) handbags\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n\\[ G_P = 26 - \frac{1}{2} \times 26 \\]\n\\[ G_P = 26 - 13 \\]\n\\[ G_P = 13 \\]\n\n\\[ G_H = 24 - \frac{1}{4} \times 24 \\]\n\\[ G_H = 24 - 6 \\]\n\\[ G_H = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ G = 13 + 18 \\]\n\\[ G = 31 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 31 genuine purses and handbags.####\n31"}
