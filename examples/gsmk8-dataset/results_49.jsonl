{"question": "Jack has $45 and 36 euros. If each euro is worth two dollars, how much money does he have total in dollars?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the amount of money Jack has in dollars, and \\( E \\) represent the amount of money Jack has in euros. Since each euro is worth two dollars, we can express \\( E \\) in terms of dollars as \\( E = 2D \\). The total amount of money \\( T \\) that Jack has in dollars is given by:\n\n\\[ T = D + E \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( E \\) in terms of dollars:\n\n\\[ T = D + 2D \\]\n\\[ T = 3D \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount of money Jack has in dollars (\\( T \\)) is three times the amount of money Jack has in dollars (\\( D \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- Jack has $45 (amount in dollars)\n- Jack has 36 euros (amount in euros)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 3 \times $45 \\]\n\\[ T = $135 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jack has a total of $135 in dollars.\n####\n117"}
