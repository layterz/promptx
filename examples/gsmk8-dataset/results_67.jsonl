{"question": "Derek finally gets his own allowance. He puts $2 away in January, $4 away in February, $8 away in March, $16 away in April and follows this savings pattern through to December. How much money does he have to spare and save by December?", "answer": "Let \\( S_J \\) represent the amount of money Derek saves in January, \\( S_F \\) represent the amount of money Derek saves in February, and so on up to \\( S_D \\) in December.
