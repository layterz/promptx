{"question": "Michael scored 260 points during his junior year on the school basketball team. He scored 20% more points during his senior year. How many points did he score during both years?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent the number of points Michael scored during his junior year, and \\( S \\) represent the number of points he scored during his senior year. The total number of points \\( T \\) scored during both years is given by:\n\n\\[ T = J + S \\]\n\nSince Michael scored 20% more points during his senior year, we can express \\( S \\) as \\( 1.20J \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = J + 1.20J \\]\n\\[ T = 2.20J \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of points scored during both years (\\( T \\)) is 2.20 times the number of points scored during his junior year (\\( J \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J = 260 \\) points (points scored during his junior year)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 2.20 \\times 260 \\]\n\\[ T = 572 \\]\n\nTherefore, Michael scored a total of 572 points during both his junior and senior years.####\n572"}
