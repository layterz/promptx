{"question": "James won a money prize at a charity raffle. He donated half of his winnings back to the charity, then spent $2 on a hot dog to celebrate his win. He had $55 left over. How many dollars did he win?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) be equal to James's raffle winnings.\n\n     He donated half of his winnings, so he had \\( \\frac{W}{2} \\) left.\n\n     He then spent $2 on a hot dog, so \\( \\frac{W}{2} - 2 = \\$55 \\).\n\n     Thus, half his winnings is \\( \\frac{W}{2} = 55 + 2 = 57 \\).\n\n     James won \\( W = 57 \\times 2 = \\$114 \\).\n\n     Therefore, James won $114. \n     ####\n     114"}
{"question": "Jenny is trying to convince her cat to walk on a leash. The cat spends twenty minutes resisting. Then Jenny coaxes the cat to walk 64 feet at a rate of 8 feet/minute. How many minutes does this whole process take?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total time it takes for the whole process. \n\nTo find the time the cat spends walking, we divide the distance (in feet) by the rate of walking (in feet per minute):\n\n\\[ \\text{walking time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{rate}} = \\frac{64 \\text{ feet}}{8 \\text{ feet/minute}} \\]\n\nNext, we add this to the time the cat spends resisting to find the total amount of time:\n\n\\[ T = \\text{walking time} + \\text{resisting time} = 8 \\text{ minutes} + 20 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nTherefore, the whole process takes a total of 28 minutes.\n\n#### \n28"}
{"question": "Dane\u2019s two daughters need to plant 5 flowers each to grow a garden. As the days passed, the flowers grew into 20 more but 10 of them died.

The total length \\( L_T \\) of the rubber, pen, and pencil altogether is given by:\n\n\\[ L_T = L_R + L_P + L_C \\]\n\nSince the pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters, we can express the length of the pen as \\( L_P = L_R + 3 \\). \n\nAlso, the pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters, so we can express the length of the pen as \\( L_P = L_C - 2 \\).\n\nCombining these two expressions, we have:\n\n\\[ L_R + 3 = L_C - 2 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ L_C = L_R + 5 \\]\n\nGiven that the length of the pencil is 12 centimeters, we have:\n\n\\[ 12 = L_R + 5 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( L_R \\), we find:\n\n\\[ L_R = 12 - 5 \\]\n\\[ L_R = 7 \\]\n\nSubstituting this value back into the equation for \\( L_C \\), we get:\n\n\\[ L_C = 7 + 5 \\]\n\\[ L_C = 12 \\]\n\nFinally, substituting the values of \\( L_R \\), \\( L_P \\), and \\( L_C \\) into the equation for \\( L_T \\), we find:\n\n\\[ L_T = 7 + 10 + 12 \\]\n\\[ L_T = 29 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of the rubber, pen, and pencil altogether is 29 centimeters.\n####\n29"}
