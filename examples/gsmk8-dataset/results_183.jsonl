{"question": "A charity is delivering chicken and rice dinners to a shelter for the hungry. They have a hundred plates to deliver. The rice cost ten cents a plate and the chicken cost forty cents a plate. How many dollars did the charity spend on the food for the dinners?", "answer": "Let \\( R \\) be the cost of a rice plate and \\( C \\) be the cost of a chicken plate. The total cost of the food for the dinners \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = (R + C) \\times N \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total cost \\( T \\) is equal to the cost of a rice plate (\\( R \\)) plus the cost of a chicken plate (\\( C \\)), multiplied by the number of plates (\\( N \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( R = 10 \\) cents (cost of a rice plate)\n- \\( C = 40 \\) cents (cost of a chicken plate)\n- \\( N = 100 \\) plates (number of plates to deliver)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = (10 + 40) \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ T = 50 \\times 100 \\]\n\\[ T = 5000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the charity spent $50 on the food for the dinners.\n####\n50"}
