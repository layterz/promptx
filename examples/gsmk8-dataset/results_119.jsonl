{"question": "Jerry is trying to cut down on the amount of soda he drinks. Right now, he drinks 48 sodas a week. If he cuts the number of sodas he drinks in half each week, how many weeks will it take him to only drink 6 sodas per week?", "answer": "Let \\( S_0 \\) be the starting number of sodas Jerry drinks per week, and \\( S_n \\) be the number of sodas Jerry drinks after \\( n \\) weeks. The equation to find the number of weeks it takes Jerry to only drink 6 sodas per week is given by:\n\n\\[ S_n = \\dfrac{S_0}{2^n} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of sodas Jerry drinks after \\( n \\) weeks (\\( S_n \\)) is equal to the starting number of sodas (\\( S_0 \\)) divided by 2 raised to the power of \\( n \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S_0 = 48 \\) sodas (starting number of sodas Jerry drinks per week)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\[ S_n = \\dfrac{48}{2^n} \\]\n\nWe need to find the value of \\( n \\) for which \\( S_n = 6 \\):\n\\[ 6 = \\dfrac{48}{2^n} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( n \\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \\( 2^n \\):\n\\[ 6 \\cdot 2^n = 48 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 6:\n\\[ 2^n = 8 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( n \\), we take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of the equation:\n\\[ \\log_2 (2^n) = \\log_2 (8) \\]\n\\[ n \\log_2 (2) = 3 \\]\n\\[ n = \\dfrac{3}{\\log_2 (2)} \\]\n\\[ n = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes Jerry 3 weeks to reduce the number of sodas he drinks per week to 6.\n####\n3"}
