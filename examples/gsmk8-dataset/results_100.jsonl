{"question": "James had two browsers on his computer. In each browser, he opened three windows, each with ten tabs. What's the total number of tabs he opened in all the browsers together?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of tabs James opened in all the browsers together. \n\nWe know that in each browser, James opened three windows, and each window had ten tabs. Therefore, the total number of tabs in three windows of each browser is \\( 10 \\times 3 \\). \n\nSo, the equation to find the total number of tabs \\( T \\) is:\n\n\\[ T = 10 \\times 3 \\]\n\nGiven the value:\n\n- \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\) tabs (total tabs in three windows of each browser)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 2 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ T = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, James opened a total of 60 tabs in all the browsers together.\n####\n60"}
{"question": "It was Trevor's job to collect fresh eggs from the family's 4 chickens every morning.   He got 4 eggs from Gertrude and 3 eggs from Blanche.  Nancy laid 2 eggs as did Martha.

The equation to find the number of eggs \\( E \\) Trevor had left after dropping some is given by:\n\n\\[ E = T - 2 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of eggs Trevor had left (\\( E \\)) is the total number of eggs collected (\\( T \\)) minus the number of eggs dropped (2).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( G = 4 \\) eggs (collected from Gertrude)\n- \\( B = 3 \\) eggs (collected from Blanche)\n- \\( N = 2 \\) eggs (eggs laid by Nancy)\n- \\( M = 2 \\) eggs (eggs laid by Martha)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = G + B + N + M \\]\n\\[ T = 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 \\]\n\\[ T = 11 \\]\n\n\\[ E = 11 - 2 \\]\n\\[ E = 9 \\]\n\nTherefore, Trevor had 9 eggs left after dropping 2 eggs.\n####\n9"}

Then, we divide the number of cheese pieces by 2 to get the number of students.\n\nLet \\( C \\) represent the number of cheese pizzas purchased.\n\nSince each student eats 2 pieces of cheese pizza and 1 piece of onion pizza, the ratio of cheese pizzas to total pizzas is 2:3 (2 pieces of cheese pizza for every 2+1=3 total pieces of pizza).\n\nTherefore, the equation to calculate the number of cheese pizzas is:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\text{total pizzas} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- The teacher orders 6 total pizzas.\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ C = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the teacher buys 4 cheese pizzas.\n\nSince each large pizza has 18 slices, the total number of cheese pieces is:\n\n\\[ \\text{total cheese pieces} = C \\times \\text{pieces per pizza} \\]\n\\[ \\text{total cheese pieces} = 4 \\times 18 \\]\n\\[ \\text{total cheese pieces} = 72 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 72 pieces of cheese pizza.\n\nGiven:\n- There are 8 pieces of cheese pizza leftover.\n\nSubtracting the leftover cheese pieces from the total number of cheese pieces:\n\n\\[ \\text{students} = \\text{total cheese pieces} - \\text{leftover cheese pieces} \\]\n\\[ \\text{students} = 72 - 8 \\]\n\\[ \\text{students} = 64 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 64 pieces of cheese pizza eaten by the students.\n\nTo find the number of students, we divide the number of cheese pieces by 2:\n\n\\[ \\text{students} = \\frac{\\text{pieces of cheese}}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{students} = \\frac{64}{2} \\]\n\\[ \\text{students} = 32 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 32 students in the class.\n####\n32"}
