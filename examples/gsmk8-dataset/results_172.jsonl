{"question": "Chester must deliver ten bales of hay to Farmer Brown. Farmer Brown wants Chester to supply better quality hay and double the delivery of bales of hay. If the previous hay cost $15 per bale, and the better quality one cost $18 per bale, how much more money will Farmer Brown need to meet his own new requirements?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the price per bale of hay, \\( N \\) represent the number of bales of hay originally required, and \\( N' \\) represent the number of bales of hay now required.\n\nThe cost of the original hay is given by:\n\\[ C = P \\times N \\]\nThe cost of the new hay is given by:\n\\[ C' = P \\times N' \\]\n\nThe cost difference is given by:\n\\[ D = C' - C \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = \\$15 \\) per bale (original price per bale)\n- \\( N = 10 \\) bales (original number of bales required)\n- \\( N' = 2 \\times N = 20 \\) bales (new number of bales required)\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\\[ C = \\$15 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ C = \\$150 \\]\n\n\\[ C' = \\$15 \\times 20 \\]\n\\[ C' = \\$360 \\]\n\n\\[ D = \\$360 - \\$150 \\]\n\\[ D = \\$210 \\]\n\nTherefore, Farmer Brown will need an additional $210 to meet his new requirements.\n####\n210"}
{"question": "Oliver is trying to decide between two different sized boxes of macaroni and cheese. He wants to know which is the better value, so instead of just looking at the overall price, he looks at the price per ounce. The larger box is 30 ounces and the smaller box is 20 ounces. The larger box costs $4.80. The smaller box costs $3.40. What is the price per ounce in cents of the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce)?", "answer": "Let \\( B_L \\) represent the price of the larger box of macaroni and cheese, \\( B_S \\) represent the price of the smaller box of macaroni and cheese, \\( O_L \\) represent the number of ounces in the larger box, \\( O_S \\) represent the number of ounces in the smaller box, and \\( P_L \\) represent the price per ounce of the larger box.\n\nThe equation to calculate the price per ounce \\( P_L \\) of the larger box is:\n\n\\[ P_L = \\frac{B_L}{O_L} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the equation to calculate the price per ounce of the smaller box \\( P_S \\) is:\n\n\\[ P_S = \\frac{B_S}{O_S} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B_L = 4.80 \\) dollars (price of the larger box)\n- \\( B_S = 3.40 \\) dollars (price of the smaller box)\n- \\( O_L = 30 \\) ounces (number of ounces in the larger box)\n- \\( O_S = 20 \\) ounces (number of ounces in the smaller box)\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n\\[ P_L = \\frac{4.80}{30} \\]\n\\[ P_S = \\frac{3.40}{20} \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[ P_L = 0.16 \\]\n\\[ P_S = 0.17 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price per ounce of the larger box is 16 cents, and the price per ounce of the smaller box is 17 cents. So the box with the better value (lowest price per ounce) is the larger box, which costs 16 cents per ounce.\n####\n16"}
{"question": "Roland needs a length of thread to complete an exercise. He has a 12cm long thread but his teacher says he needs an additional three-quarters of what he has. What is the total length required?", "answer": "Let \\( L_t \\) represent the total length of thread required, and \\( L_i \\) represent the initial length of thread that Roland has. The additional length of thread required (\\( L_a \\)) is three-quarters (\\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)) of the initial length of thread. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ L_a = L_i \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\]\n\nThe total length of thread required is the sum of the initial length of thread and the additional length of thread:\n\n\\[ L_t = L_i + L_a \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( L_i = 12 \\) cm (initial length of thread)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ L_a = 12 \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\]\n\\[ L_a = 9 \\]\n\n\\[ L_t = 12 + 9 \\]\n\\[ L_t = 21 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total length of thread required is 21 cm.\n####\n21"}
{"question": "Donald drinks 3 more than twice the number of juice bottles Paul drinks in one day. If Paul drinks 3 bottles of juice per day, how many bottles does Donald drink per day?", "answer": "Let D represent the number of bottles that Donald drinks in one day, and P represent the number of bottles that Paul drinks in one day. \n\nThe equation to find the number of bottles that Donald drinks in one day is given by:\n\nD = 2P + 3\n\nThis equation states that the number of bottles that Donald drinks in one day (D) is twice the number of bottles that Paul drinks in one day (2P), plus 3 more bottles. \n\nGiven:\n- P = 3 bottles (number of bottles that Paul drinks in one day)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\nD = 2 * 3 + 3\nD = 6 + 3\nD = 9\n\nTherefore, Donald drinks 9 bottles per day. \n#### 9"}
