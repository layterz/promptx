{"question": "Alexander is going food shopping. If he buys 5 apples for $1 each and 2 oranges for $2 each, how much does he spend?", "answer": "Let \\( A \\) represent the number of apples Alexander buys and \\( O \\) represent the number of oranges he buys. The total amount Alexander spends \\( S \\) can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n\\[ S = A \\times P_A + O \\times P_O \\]\n\nwhere \\( P_A \\) is the price of one apple and \\( P_O \\) is the price of one orange.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A = 5 \\) apples\n- \\( O = 2 \\) oranges\n- \\( P_A = $1 \\) per apple\n- \\( P_O = $2 \\) per orange\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 5 \\times $1 + 2 \\times $2 \\]\n\\[ S = $5 + $4 \\]\n\\[ S = $9 \\]\n\nTherefore, Alexander spends a total of $9.####\n9"}
{"question": "A wild tiger escapes the zoo.  He escapes at 1 AM and zookeepers do not notice he is missing until 4 AM.  He runs at a speed of 25 mph.  It takes 2 more hours to find him but after 4 hours of running, the tiger slows his speed to 10 mph.  He then gets chased for half an hour going 50 mph.  How far away from the zoo was he caught?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) be the total time the tiger was running, \\( S \\) be the total distance the tiger ran, \\( t_1 \\) be the time the tiger ran at 25 mph, and \\( t_2 \\) be the time the tiger ran at 10 mph.\n\nWe know that \\( t_1 = 4 - 3 = 1 \\) hour, \\( t_2 = t_{chase} = 0.5 \\) hour, and \\( T = (4 - 1) + t_{chase} + t1 = 3 + 0.5 + 1 = 4.5 \\) hours.\n\nWe also know that the tiger ran at 25 mph for 3 hours, so the distance he covered during that time is \\( d_1 = t_1 \\times 25 = 1 \\times 25 = 25 \\) miles.\n\nSimilarly, the tiger ran at 10 mph for 1 hour, so the distance he covered during that time is \\( d_2 = t_2 \\times 10 = 0.5 \\times 10 = 5 \\) miles.\n\nDuring the chase, the tiger ran at 50 mph for 0.5 hour, so the distance he covered during that time is \\( d_{chase} = t_{chase} \\times 50 = 0.5 \\times 50 = 25 \\) miles.\n\nTherefore, the total distance the tiger ran is \\( S = d_1 + d_2 + d_{chase} = 25 + 5 + 25 = 55 \\) miles.\n\n\nTherefore, the tiger was caught 55 miles away from the zoo.\n#### 55"}
{"question": "One-third of a class of 39 students took part in a math competition.

The number of students who did not participate in the competition can be found by subtracting the number of participating students (\\( P \\)) from the total number of students (\\( C \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 39 \\) students (total number of students in the class)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\( P = C \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\\( P = 39 \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n\\( P = 13 \\)\n\nTherefore, the number of students who did not participate in the competition is \\( C - P \\), which is \\( 39 - 13 \\), resulting in 26.\n\nHence, there are 26 students who did not participate in the math competition.\n####\n26"}
{"question": "Five times a week, Onur bikes 250 kilometers a day. His friend Hanil bikes 40 more kilometers of Onur biking distance in a day.
