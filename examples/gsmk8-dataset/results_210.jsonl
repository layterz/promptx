{"question": "Bridgette and Alex are getting married. Bridgette is inviting 84 guests, and Alex is inviting two thirds of that number of guests. They hired a caterer to make a plated meal for each guest at the wedding reception. The caterer always makes ten extra plates just in case something goes wrong. Each plate of steak and asparagus in garlic butter will have 8 asparagus spears on it. How many asparagus spears will the caterer need in all?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) be the number of guests Bridgette is inviting and \\( A \\) be the number of guests Alex is inviting. The total number of guests \\( T \\) attending the wedding is given by:\n\n\\[ T = B + A \\]\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that \\( A \\) is two-thirds of \\( B \\), so we can write:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{2}{3}B \\]\n\nSubstituting this into the equation for \\( T \\), we have:\n\n\\[ T = B + \\frac{2}{3}B \\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{5}{3}B \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of guests (\\( T \\)) is equal to five-thirds times the number of guests Bridgette is inviting (\\( B \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 84 \\) (number of guests Bridgette is inviting)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 84 \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{420}{3} \\]\n\\[ T = 140 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bridgette and Alex are inviting a total of 140 guests to the wedding.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of plates needed and the number of asparagus spears needed.\n\nTo find the number of plates needed, we add the number of guests Bridgette is inviting to the number of guests Alex is inviting:\n\n\\[ \\text{{Number of plates}} = B + A \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Number of plates}} = 84 + 56 \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Number of plates}} = 140 \\]\n\nSince the caterer always makes 10 extra plates, we add 10 to the number of plates needed:\n\n\\[ \\text{{Total number of plates needed}} = \\text{{Number of plates}} + 10 \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Total number of plates needed}} = 140 + 10 \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Total number of plates needed}} = 150 \\]\n\nFinally, to find the number of asparagus spears needed, we multiply the total number of plates needed by the number of asparagus spears on each plate (8):\n\n\\[ \\text{{Number of asparagus spears needed}} = \\text{{Total number of plates needed}} \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Number of asparagus spears needed}} = 150 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ \\text{{Number of asparagus spears needed}} = 1200 \\]\n\nTherefore, the caterer will need a total of 1200 asparagus spears for the wedding reception. \n####\n1200"}

The total amount of money \\( T \\) that John gets from both grandparents is given by:\n\n\\[ T = G + M \\]\n\nSince John gets 3 times as much money from his grandma as he gets from his grandpa, we can express \\( M \\) as \\( 3G \\).
