The total number of open parking spots \\( S_T \\) in all levels is given by:\n\n\\[ S_T = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S_1 = 4 \\) spots (open parking spots on the first level)\n- \\( S_2 = S_1 + 7 \\) spots (open parking spots on the second level, which is 7 spots more than on the first level)\n- \\( S_3 = S_2 + 6 \\) spots (open parking spots on the third level, which is 6 spots more than on the second level)\n- \\( S_4 = 14 \\) spots (open parking spots on the fourth level)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S_T = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 4 + (S_1 + 7) + (S_2 + 6) + 14 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 4 + 7 + 6 + S_1 + S_2 + 14 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 4 + 7 + 6 + 4 + (S_1 + 7) + 14 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 4 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 7 + 14 + S_1 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 11 + 13 + S_1 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 24 + S_1 \\]\n\nSince the number of open parking spots on the first level (\\( S_1 \\)) is given as 4, we can substitute it into the equation:\n\n\\[ S_T = 24 + 4 \\]\n\\[ S_T = 28 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 28 open parking spots in all.####\n28"}
{"question": "Anna sold 36 glasses of plain lemonade for $0.75 each. If she made $16 total from selling strawberry lemonade, how much more did she make from plain lemonade than strawberry?", "answer": "Let \\( E_P \\) represent Anna's earnings from selling plain lemonade and \\( E_S \\) represent her earnings from selling strawberry lemonade. The difference in earnings between plain and strawberry lemonade can be found by subtracting \\( E_S \\) from \\( E_P \\). \n\nGiven:\n- Anna sold 36 glasses of plain lemonade for $0.75 each, so \\( E_P = 36 \\times \\$0.75 = \\$27 \\) (plain lemonade earnings)\n- Anna made $16 total from selling strawberry lemonade, so \\( E_S = \\$16 \\) (strawberry lemonade earnings)\n\nTo find the difference in earnings:\n\\( \\text{Difference} = E_P - E_S \\)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\( \\text{Difference} = \\$27 - \\$16 \\)\n\\( \\text{Difference} = \\$11 \\)\n\nTherefore, Anna made $11 more from selling plain lemonade than strawberry lemonade. \n####\n11"}
{"question": "For every 5 people that attend a poetry class, the teacher gives one of the students a lollipop. If 45 people show up for class, then another 15 come in a while later, how many lollipops did the teacher give away?", "answer": "Let \\( P_t \\) represent the total number of people who attended the poetry class, and \\( P_g \\) represent the number of lollipops given away. We are given that for every 5 people, one lollipop is given away. Therefore, the equation to find the number of lollipops given away is:\n\n\\[ P_g = \frac{P_t}{5} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of lollipops given away (\\( P_g \\)) is the total number of people who attended the class (\\( P_t \\)) divided by 5.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_t = 45 + 15 = 60 \\) people (total number of people who attended the class)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_g = \frac{60}{5} \\]\n\\[ P_g = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, the teacher gave away 12 lollipops.####\n12"}
{"question": "There is a pie-eating contest at school. Adam eats three more pies than Bill. Sierra eats twice as many pies as Bill. If Sierra ate 12 pies, how many pies were eaten in total?", "answer": "Let \\( P_B \\) represent the number of pies eaten by Bill, \\( P_A \\) represent the number of pies eaten by Adam, and \\( P_S \\) represent the number of pies eaten by Sierra. The total number of pies eaten \\( P_T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ P_T = P_B + P_A + P_S \\]\n\nSince Adam eats three more pies than Bill, we can express \\( P_A \\) as \\( P_B + 3 \\). And since Sierra eats twice as many pies as Bill, we can express \\( P_S \\) as \\( 2P_B \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ P_T = P_B + P_B + 3 + 2P_B \\]\n\\[ P_T = 4P_B + 3 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of pies eaten (\\( P_T \\)) is four times the number of pies eaten by Bill (\\( P_B \\)) plus three.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_S = 12 \\) pies (pies eaten by Sierra)\n\nWe can solve for \\( P_B \\) using the equation:\n\n\\[ P_S = 4P_B + 3 \\]\n\\[ 12 = 4P_B + 3 \\]\n\\[ 9 = 4P_B \\]\n\\[ P_B = \\frac{9}{4} \\]\n\nHowever, since the number of pies eaten must be a whole number, we must round \\( P_B \\) to the nearest whole number.
