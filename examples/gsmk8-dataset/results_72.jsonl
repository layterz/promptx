{"question": "A nail salon was completely booked at 2 pm for manicures.  Each manicure costs $20.00 per client so the salon made $200.00.  If there are 210 fingers in the salon at 2 pm, and everyone has 10 fingers, how many people in the salon are not clients?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the number of clients in the salon and \\( P \\) represent the total number of people in the salon. The number of people \\( N \\) who are not clients can be found by subtracting the number of clients from the total number of people:\n\n\\[ N = P - C \\]\n\nWe are given:\n- The salon made $200.00 and charges $20.00 per client, so there are \\( C = \\frac{{\\$200.00}}{{\\$20.00}} = 10 \\) clients in the salon.\n- There are 210 fingers in the salon, and everyone has 10 fingers, so there are \\( P = \\frac{{210}}{{10}} = 21 \\) people in the salon.\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\[ N = 21 - 10 \\]\n\\[ N = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 11 people in the salon who are not clients.\n####\n11"}
