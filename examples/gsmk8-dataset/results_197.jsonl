{"question": "Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year, which is 3 times as much as he could lift last year. How many pounds can Kyle lift in all?", "answer": "Let K represent the number of pounds Kyle could lift last year and L represent the number of pounds Kyle can lift this year. The equation to find the total number of pounds T Kyle can lift is given by:\n\n\\[ T = K + L \\]\n\nSince Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year and that is 3 times what he could do before, we can express L as 3K. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = K + 3K \\]\n\\[ T = 4K \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of pounds Kyle can lift (T) is four times the number of pounds he could lift last year (K).\n\nGiven:\n- K = 20 pounds (pounds Kyle could lift last year)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 4 \\times 20 \\]\n\\[ T = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kyle can lift a total of 80 pounds."}
