{"question": "Teresa is collecting pencils. She has 14 colored pencils and 35 black pencils. Her three younger siblings need pencils for class and their dad asks her to share all her pencils, giving each an equal number of pencils, regardless of color. He tells her she can keep 10 of them for herself. How many pencils does each sibling get?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the number of colored pencils Teresa has and \\( B \\) represent the number of black pencils Teresa has. The total number of pencils \\( P \\) that Teresa has is given by:\n\n\\[ P = C + B \\]\n\nThe number of pencils Teresa gives away (\\( G \\)) is equal to the total number of pencils Teresa has minus the number of pencils she keeps for herself (\\( K \\)):\n\n\\[ G = P - K \\]\n\nFinally, to find the number of pencils each sibling gets (\\( S \\)), we divide the number of pencils Teresa gives away by the number of siblings (\\( N \\)):\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{G}{N} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 14 \\) colored pencils\n- \\( B = 35 \\) black pencils\n- \\( K = 10 \\) pencils Teresa keeps for herself\n- \\( N = 3 \\) number of siblings\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n\\[ P = 14 + 35 \\]\n\\[ P = 49 \\]\n\n\\[ G = 49 - 10 \\]\n\\[ G = 39 \\]\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{39}{3} \\]\n\\[ S = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, each sibling will get 13 pencils.\n####\n13"}
{"question": "There were 10000 spectators at a basketball match. 7000 of them were men. Of the remaining spectators, there were 5 times as many children as women. How many children were there?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) be the total number of spectators, \\( M \\) be the number of men, \\( W \\) be the number of women, and \\( C \\) be the number of children. The equation to find the number of children \\( C \\) at the basketball match is given by:\n\n\\[ T = M + W + C \\]\n\nWe know that there were 10,000 spectators in total and 7,000 of them were men. So we can express the equation as:\n\n\\[ 10,000 = 7,000 + W + C \\]\n\nWe also know that the remaining spectators (women and children) can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\[ W + C = 10,000 - 7,000 \\]\n\nAnd we are given that there were 5 times as many children as women, so we can express the equation as:\n\n\\[ C = 5W \\]\n\nWe can substitute the value of \\( C \\) in terms of \\( W \\) into the equation \\( W + C = 10,000 - 7,000 \\):\n\n\\[ W + 5W = 3,000 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 6W = 3,000 \\]\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 6:\n\n\\[ W = 500 \\]\n\nNow that we know the number of women, we can substitute this value into the equation \\( C = 5W \\):\n\n\\[ C = 5(500) \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ C = 2,500 \\]\n\nTherefore, there were 2,500 children at the basketball match.\n####\n2500"}
{"question": "Mcgregor and Floyd were assigned 89 books to read for the week. If Mcgregor was able to finish 34 while Floyd was able to finish 32, how many books do they still have to read?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of books assigned, \\( B_M \\) represent the number of books Mcgregor finished, and \\( B_F \\) represent the number of books Floyd finished. The equation to find the number of books \\( B_R \\) they still have to read is given by:\n\n\\[ B_R = T - (B_M + B_F) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of books they still have to read (\\( B_R \\)) is the difference between the total number of books assigned (\\( T \\)) and the sum of the books Mcgregor finished (\\( B_M \\)) and the books Floyd finished (\\( B_F \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 89 \\) books (total books assigned)\n- \\( B_M = 34 \\) books (books Mcgregor finished)\n- \\( B_F = 32 \\) books (books Floyd finished)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ B_R = 89 - (34 + 32) \\]\n\\[ B_R = 89 - 66 \\]\n\\[ B_R = 23 \\]\n\nTherefore, they still have to read a total of 23 books.####23"}
{"question": "Last month, you borrowed $100 from your friend.
