{"question": "A pipe is clogged so that only 2 ounces of cleaner can run through the pipe per minute. After fifteen minutes, the cleaner has unclogged it enough that 3 ounces can run through per minute. Ten minutes later, the clog is cleared enough for 4 ounces to run through per minute. How many ounces of cleaner were used after 30 minutes?", "answer": "Let \\( P_1 \\), \\( P_2 \\), and \\( P_3 \\) represent the amount of cleaner (in ounces) that can run through the pipe per minute after 15, 10, and 5 minutes, respectively. Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of minutes. The equation to find the total amount of cleaner \\( C_T \\) used after 30 minutes is given by:\n\n\\[ C_T = (P_1 \\cdot 15) + (P_2 \\cdot 10) + (P_3 \\cdot (T - 15 - 10)) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount of cleaner used \\( C_T \\) is equal to the amount of cleaner used per minute (\\( P_i \\)) multiplied by the number of minutes (\\( T \\)) for each time period.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_1 = 2 \\) ounces per minute (after 15 minutes)\n- \\( P_2 = 3 \\) ounces per minute (after 10 more minutes)\n- \\( P_3 = 4 \\) ounces per minute (after 5 more minutes)\n- \\( T = 30 \\) minutes\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_T = (2 \\cdot 15) + (3 \\cdot 10) + (4 \\cdot (30 - 15 - 10)) \\]\n\\[ C_T = 30 + 30 + (4 \\cdot 5) \\]\n\\[ C_T = 30 + 30 + 20 \\]\n\\[ C_T = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, 80 ounces of cleaner were used after 30 minutes. \n####\n80"}
{"question": "Four tires and one battery together cost $224. Each tire costs $42. Calculate the price of the battery.", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the cost of the four tires and \\( B \\) represent the price of the battery. The total cost of the four tires and battery is given by:\n\n\\[ T + B = 224 \\]\n\nSince each tire costs $42, the equation can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ 42 \\times 4 + B = 224 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 168 + B = 224 \\]\n\\[ B = 224 - 168 \\]\n\\[ B = 56 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the battery is $56.\n#### 56"}
{"question": "A neighborhood association decided to plant a tree on every street. There are eighteen streets in the neighborhood. The association wanted every other tree to be a fruit tree, and they agreed to plant equal numbers of plum, pear, and apricot trees. How many of each kind of tree will they plant?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) represent the number of streets in the neighborhood. Since the association wants to plant trees on every street, there will be a total of \\( N \\) trees.\n\nThe association wants every other tree to be a fruit tree, so the number of fruit trees planted (\\( F_t \\)) will be half of the total number of trees. Therefore:\n\n\\[ F_t = \\frac{N}{2} \\]\n\nThe association also agreed to plant equal numbers of plum, pear, and apricot trees. Since there are three kinds of fruit trees, the number of each kind of tree planted (\\( T_k \\)) will be the number of fruit trees divided by three. Therefore:\n\n\\[ T_k = \\frac{F_t}{3} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( N = 18 \\) streets (number of streets in the neighborhood)\n\nApplying the values to the equations:\n\n\\[ F_t = \\frac{18}{2} \\]\n\\[ F_t = 9 \\]\n\n\\[ T_k = \\frac{9}{3} \\]\n\\[ T_k = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the association will plant 3 plum trees, 3 pear trees, and 3 apricot trees.####\n3"}
