{"question": "Fern is checking IDs to get into an R-rated movie. She denied 20% of the 120 kids from Riverside High, 70% of the 90 kids from West Side High, and half the 50 kids from Mountaintop High. How many kids got into the movie?", "answer": "Let \\( N_R \\) represent the number of kids from Riverside High, \\( N_W \\) represent the number of kids from West Side High, and \\( N_M \\) represent the number of kids from Mountaintop High. The total number of kids \\( N_T \\) trying to get into the movie is given by:\n\n\\[ N_T = N_R + N_W + N_M \\]\n\nWe are given:\n- \\( N_R = 120 \\) kids (number of kids from Riverside High)\n- \\( N_W = 90 \\) kids (number of kids from West Side High)\n- \\( N_M = 50 \\) kids (number of kids from Mountaintop High)\n\nApplying the values to the formula, we have:\n\n\\[ N_T = 120 + 90 + 50 \\]\n\\[ N_T = 260 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 260 kids trying to get into the movie.\n\nLet \\( R_R \\) represent the percentage of kids rejected from Riverside High, \\( R_W \\) represent the percentage of kids rejected from West Side High, and \\( R_M \\) represent the percentage of kids rejected from Mountaintop High. The number of kids rejected from each school is given by:\n\n\\[ R_R = \\frac{{20}}{{100}} \\times N_R \\]\n\\[ R_W = \\frac{{70}}{{100}} \\times N_W \\]\n\\[ R_M = \\frac{{1}}{{2}} \\times N_M \\]\n\nWe are given:\n- \\( R_R = 20\\% \\) (percentage of kids rejected from Riverside High)\n- \\( R_W = 70\\% \\) (percentage of kids rejected from West Side High)\n- \\( R_M = \\frac{{1}}{{2}} \\) (percentage of kids rejected from Mountaintop High)\n\nApplying the values to the formulas, we have:\n- \\( R_R = \\frac{{20}}{{100}} \\times 120 = 24 \\) kids (number of kids rejected from Riverside High)\n- \\( R_W = \\frac{{70}}{{100}} \\times 90 = 63 \\) kids (number of kids rejected from West Side High)\n- \\( R_M = \\frac{{1}}{{2}} \\times 50 = 25 \\) kids (number of kids rejected from Mountaintop High)\n\nNow, to find the number of kids who got into the movie, we subtract the number of kids rejected from the total number of kids:\n\n\\[ N_G = N_T - R_R - R_W - R_M \\]\n\\[ N_G = 260 - 24 - 63 - 25 \\]\n\\[ N_G = 148 \\]\n\nTherefore, 148 kids got into the movie. \n####\n148"}
{"question": "Larry spends half an hour twice a day walking and playing with his dog. He also spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog. How many minutes does Larry spend on his dog each day?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) represent the time spent walking and playing with the dog, \\( F \\) represent the time spent feeding the dog, and \\( T \\) represent the total time spent on the dog each day.\n\nThe equation to calculate the total time spent on the dog is given by:\n\n\\[ T = W + F \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W = 30 \\) minutes (time spent walking and playing with the dog)\n- \\( F = \\frac{1}{5} \\) hour = 12 minutes (time spent feeding the dog)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = 30 + 12 \\]\n\\[ T = 42 \\]\n\nTherefore, Larry spends a total of 42 minutes on his dog each day.\n####\n42"}
{"question": "A cleaning company produces two sanitizer sprays. One spray kills 50% of germs, and another spray kills 25% of germs. However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones. What percentage of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together?", "answer": "Let \\( P_1 \\) represent the percentage of germs killed by the first spray, and \\( P_2 \\) represent the percentage of germs killed by the second spray. The percentage of germs remaining after using both sanitizer sprays is given by:\n\n\\[ P_r = 100 - (P_1 + P_2 - P_1 \\times P_2) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the percentage of germs remaining (\\( P_r \\)) is equal to 100 minus the sum of the percentages of germs killed by the sprays (\\( P_1 + P_2 \\)) plus the percentage of germs that were killed by both sprays (\\( P_1 \\times P_2 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_1 = 50 \\) (percentage of germs killed by the first spray)\n- \\( P_2 = 25 - 5 = 20 \\) (percentage of germs killed by the second spray, after subtracting the percentage of germs already killed by the first spray)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_r = 100 - (50 + 20 - 50 \\times 20) \\]\n\\[ P_r = 100 - (50 + 20 - 1000) \\]\n\\[ P_r = 100 - 70 + 1000 \\]\n\\[ P_r = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, after using both sanitizer sprays together, 30% of germs would be left.####\n30"}

The equation to find the number of goldfish \\( B \\) below the surface is given by:\n\n\\[ B = T - S \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of goldfish below the surface (\\( B \\)) is equal to the total number of goldfish (\\( T \\)) minus the number of goldfish at the surface (\\( S \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = 25\\% \\) of \\( T \\) (number of goldfish at the surface)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ B = T - \\left(S \\times T\\right) \\]\n\\[ B = T - ST \\]\n\\[ B = T \\left(1 - S\\right) \\]\n\nWe know that \\( S = 25\\% = 0.25 \\), so the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ B = T \\left(1 - 0.25\\right) \\]\n\\[ B = T \\times 0.75 \\]\n\nGiven that Toby counts 15 goldfish, we can set \\( T = 15 \\) and solve for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ B = 15 \\times 0.75 \\]\n\\[ B = 11.25 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 11.25 (or approximately 11) goldfish below the surface. \n####\n11"}
