{"question": "Zilla spent 7% of her monthly earnings on rent, half of it on her other monthly expenses, and put the rest in her savings. If she spent $133 on her rent, how much does she deposit into her savings account in a month?", "answer": "Let \\( E \\) represent Zilla's monthly earnings, \\( R \\) represent the amount spent on rent, \\( O \\) represent the amount spent on other monthly expenses, and \\( S \\) represent the amount deposited into her savings account in a month. The equation to find the amount deposited into her savings account is given by:\n\n\\[ S = E - (R + O) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount deposited into her savings account (\\( S \\)) is equal to her monthly earnings (\\( E \\)) minus the total amount spent on rent (\\( R \\)) and other monthly expenses (\\( O \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( R = \\$133 \\) (amount spent on rent)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ S = E - (133 + O) \\]\n\nSince \\( R \\) is 7% of her earnings (\\( E \\)), we can express it as \\( 0.07E \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ S = E - (0.07E + O) \\]\n\nSince half of her earnings are spent on other monthly expenses (\\( O \\)), we can express \\( O \\) as \\( 0.5E \\). Substituting this value in the equation:\n\n\\[ S = E - (0.07E + 0.5E) \\]\n\\[ S = E - 0.57E \\]\n\\[ S = 0.43E \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount deposited into her savings account (\\( S \\)) is 43% of her monthly earnings (\\( E \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( R = \\$133 \\) (amount spent on rent)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 0.43 \\times E \\]\n\nSince \\( R \\) is equal to 7% of her earnings:\n\n\\[ \\$133 = 0.07 \\times E \\]\n\nSolving for \\( E \\):\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{{\\$133}}{{0.07}} \\]\n\\[ E = \\$1900 \\]\n\nTherefore, Zilla deposits $817 into her savings account per month.\n####\n817"}
{"question": "Jerry is refilling the duck pond in his backyard during a drought. The pond can hold 200 gallons of water. Jerry's hose can normally pump 6 gallons/minute, but due to drought restrictions, it can only pump 2/3rds as fast right now. How many minutes will it take Jerry to fill his pond?", "answer": "Let \\( R \\) be the normal rate at which Jerry's hose pumps water, and let \\( R_c \\) be the current rate at which the hose pumps water. The equation to find the number of minutes \\( N \\) it takes to fill the pond is given by:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{{\\text{{number of gallons in the pond}}}}{{\\text{{gallons pumped each minute}}}} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the current rate \\( R_c \\) at which the hose pumps water. Given that the current rate is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) times the normal rate, we can express \\( R_c \\) as:\n\n\\[ R_c = \\frac{2}{3} \\times R \\]\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{{\\text{{number of gallons in the pond}}}}{{R_c}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- The pond can hold 200 gallons of water (\\( \\text{{number of gallons in the pond}} = 200 \\))\n- The normal rate is 6 gallons/minute (\\( R = 6 \\))\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{{200}}{{R_c}} \\]\n\\[ N = \\frac{{200}}{{\\frac{2}{3} \\times 6}} \\]\n\\[ N = \\frac{{200}}{{2 \\times 3}} \\]\n\\[ N = \\frac{{200}}{{6}} \\]\n\\[ N = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Jerry 50 minutes to fill his pond. \n#### 50"}
{"question": "Rohan owns a 20-square meter coconut farm. Each square meter has 2 coconut trees and each tree has 6 coconuts.
