{"question": "I run 12 miles in 90 minutes. What is my average speed in miles per hour?", "answer": "To find your average speed in miles per hour, you need to divide the total distance you ran by the total time it took you. \n\nLet \\( D \\) represent the distance you ran and \\( T \\) represent the time it took you. The equation to find your average speed \\( S \\) in miles per hour is:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{D}{T} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D = 12 \\) miles (total distance you ran)\n- \\( T = 90 \\) minutes (total time it took you)\n\nFirst, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours:\n\\[ T = \\frac{90 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes/hour}} = 1.5 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow we can plug the values into the equation:\n\\[ S = \\frac{12 \\text{ miles}}{1.5 \\text{ hours}} = 8 \\text{ miles/hour} \\]\n\nTherefore, your average speed is 8 miles per hour.\n####\n8"}
{"question": "Chenny bought 9 plates at $2 each. She also bought spoons at $1.50 each. How many spoons did Chenny buy if she paid a total of $24 for the plates and spoon?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the number of plates bought and \\( S \\) represent the number of spoons bought. The equation to find the number of spoons \\( S \\) bought by Chenny is given by:\n\n\\[ P \\times 2 + S \\times 1.50 = 24 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total cost of the plates and spoons is equal to $24.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 9 \\) plates (number of plates bought)\n- The cost of each plate is $2\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 2 + S \\times 1.50 = 24 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 18 + 1.50S = 24 \\]\n\nSubtracting 18 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 1.50S = 6 \\]\n\nDividing by 1.50:\n\n\\[ S = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Chenny bought a total of 4 spoons.\n\n####\n4"}
{"question": "Spike the bearded dragon eats crickets to get protein in his diet. He hunts 5 crickets every morning and three times that over the afternoon and evening, munching on leafy greens and other vegetation in between. How many crickets does Spike hunt per day?", "answer": "Let \\( C_M \\) represent the number of crickets Spike hunts in the morning, and \\( C_A \\) represent the number of crickets Spike hunts in the afternoon and evening. The total number of crickets \\( C_T \\) Spike hunts per day is given by:\n\n\\[ C_T = C_M + C_A \\]\n\nSince Spike hunts three times the number of crickets in the afternoon and evening compared to the morning, we can express \\( C_A \\) as \\( 3C_M \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ C_T = C_M + 3C_M \\]\n\\[ C_T = 4C_M \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of crickets Spike hunts per day (\\( C_T \\)) is four times the number of crickets he hunts in the morning (\\( C_M \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C_M = 5 \\) crickets (crickets Spike hunts in the morning)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_T = 4 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ C_T = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, Spike hunts a total of 20 crickets per day.\n#### 20"}
{"question": "It takes Derek 9 minutes to walk a mile if he doesn't have to walk with his brother. If he has to take his brother it takes 12 minutes to walk a mile.
