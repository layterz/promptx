{"question": "Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?", "answer": "Let \\(L\\) be the number of levels of the pyramid, and \\(S\\) be the length of each side of a level.\n\nWe know that the top level has just one case. Since each level has one more case per side than the level above it, the second level has sides that are 2 cases long. We can find the area of a square with side length 2 to determine how many cases are needed for the second level: \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) cases.\n\nSimilarly, the third level has three cases per side, so we can find the area of a square with side length 3 to determine the number of cases needed: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) cases.\n\nThe fourth level has a side length of 4, so its area can be found by multiplying 4 cases by 4 cases: \\(4 \\times 4 = 16\\) cases.\n\nFinally, we add up the number of cases needed on each level: 1 case + 4 cases + 9 cases + 16 cases = 30 cases.\n\nTherefore, Mark needs a total of 30 cases of soda for the pyramid.####\n30"}
{"question": "Peter knows that the distance an airplane travels between Spain and Russia is 7019 km, while the distance between Spain and Germany is 1615 km.
