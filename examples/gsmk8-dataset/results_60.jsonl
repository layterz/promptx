{"question": "Joel is 5 years old and his dad is 32 years old.  How old will Joel be when his dad is twice as old as him?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent Joel's age and \\( D \\) represent his dad's age. The equation to find out how old Joel will be when his dad is twice as old as him is:\n\n\\[ D + (D - J) = 2J \\]\n\nThis equation states that the sum of his dad's age and the difference in age between Joel and his dad is equal to twice Joel's age.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J = 5 \\) years (Joel's age)\n- \\( D = 32 \\) years (his dad's age)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 32 + (32 - 5) = 2 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ 32 + 27 = 10 \\]\n\\[ 59 = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, when his dad is twice as old as him, Joel will be 27 years old. \n####\n27"}
{"question": "Will and Henry go fishing in a river. Will catches 16 catfish and 10 eels. Henry challenges himself to catch 3 trout for every catfish Will catches. Due to environmental concerns, Henry decides to return half his catch after meeting his own challenge. How many fishes do they have altogether now?", "answer": "Let \\(C_w\\) represent the number of catfish Will catches, \\(C_h\\) represent the number of trout Henry catches, and \\(T_h\\) represent the number of trout caught per catfish. The total number of fishes \\(T\\) they have altogether is given by:\n\n\\[T = C_w + C_h\\]\n\nSince Henry catches 3 trout for each catfish Will catches, we can express \\(C_h\\) as \\(T_h \\times C_w\\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[T = C_w + T_h \\times C_w\\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of fishes \\(T\\) they have altogether is the sum of the number of catfish Will catches (\\(C_w\\)) and the number of trout Henry catches (\\(C_h\\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(C_w = 16\\) catfish (catfish caught by Will)\n- \\(C_h = T_h \\times C_w\\) (trout caught by Henry, which is 3 times the number of catfish Will catches)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[T = 16 + T_h \\times 16\\]\n\nWe can now find \\(T_h\\) by considering that Henry decides to return half of his catch (\\(0.5 \\times C_h\\)), leaving him with \\(C_h - 0.5 \\times C_h\\) trout. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[C_h - 0.5 \\times C_h = 48 - 0.5 \\times 48\\]\n\\[0.5 \\times C_h = 0.5 \\times 48\\]\n\\[C_h = 24\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(C_h\\) into the equation:\n\n\\[T = 16 + 3 \\times 16\\]\n\\[T = 16 + 48\\]\n\\[T = 64\\]\n\nTherefore, they now have a total of 64 fishes altogether. \n####\n64"}

{"question": "On Friday, Markeesha sold 30 boxes of crackers for her scout troop's fundraiser. On Saturday, she sold twice as many as on Friday. On Sunday, she sold 15 fewer than Saturday.

The total number of boxes \\( B_T \\) sold over the three days is given by:\n\n\\[ B_T = B_F + B_S + B_Su \\]\n\nSince \\( B_S \\) is twice the number of boxes sold on Friday, we can express \\( B_S \\) as \\( 2 \\times B_F \\).
