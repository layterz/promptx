{"question": "Rodney, Roger and Ron can lift a combined weight of 239 pounds.  Rodney can lift twice as much as Roger, and Roger can lift 7 pounds less than 4 times the amount that Ron can lift.  How much can Rodney lift?", "answer": "Let \\( R \\) represent the amount that Rodney can lift, \\( r \\) represent the amount that Roger can lift, and \\( r \\) represent the amount that Ron can lift. \n\nGiven:\n- Rodney can lift twice as much as Roger, so \\( R = 2r \\).\n- Roger can lift 7 pounds less than 4 times the amount that Ron can lift, so \\( r = 4r - 7 \\).\n- Rodney, Roger, and Ron can lift a combined weight of 239 pounds, so \\( R + r + r = 239 \\).\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( R \\) in terms of \\( r \\) into the third equation:\n\\( 2r + r + r = 239 \\)\n\\( 4r = 239 \\)\n\\( r = \\frac{239}{4} \\)\n\\( r = 59.75 \\)\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( r \\) into the second equation to find \\( R \\):\n\\( R = 2(59.75) \\)\n\\( R = 119.5 \\)\n\nTherefore, Rodney can lift 119.5 pounds.\n\n#### 119.5"}
{"question": "Jack says he has 13 more notebooks in his bag than Gerald. Jack gives 5 notebooks to Paula and 6 notebooks to Mike.

{"question": "A movie theater company is advertising a deal of a movie ticket, a bucket of popcorn, a drink, and a box of candy for $20. Normally, a movie ticket costs $8, a bucket of popcorn costs three dollars less, a drink costs a dollar more than popcorn, and a candy costs half as much as a drink. How many dollars does the deal save a customer who buys a ticket, popcorn, drink, and candy normally?", "answer": "Let's define the variables as follows:\n- \\(T\\) represents the cost of a movie ticket\n- \\(P\\) represents the cost of a bucket of popcorn\n- \\(D\\) represents the cost of a drink\n- \\(C\\) represents the cost of a box of candy\n\nBased on the given information, we can deduce the following equations:\n- \\(P = T - 3\\) (The popcorn costs three dollars less than a movie ticket)\n- \\(D = P + 1\\) (The drink costs a dollar more than the popcorn)\n- \\(C = \\frac{D}{2}\\) (The candy costs half as much as the drink)\n\nSo, the total cost of buying a ticket, popcorn, drink, and candy normally is:\n\\(T + P + D + C = T + (T - 3) + (P + 1) + \\frac{D}{2} = 4T - 2 + 1 + \\frac{4T - 6}{2} = 4T + 4T - 8 = 8T - 8\\)\n\nSince the deal costs $20, the equation for the deal price is:\n\\(T + P + D + C = 20\\)\n\nTo find how much the deal saves a customer, we subtract the deal price from the normal price:\n\\(8T - 8 - 20 = 8T - 28\\)\n\nTherefore, the deal saves a customer \\(8T - 28\\) dollars.\n\nGiven:\n- \\(T = 8\\) dollars (the cost of a movie ticket)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\\(8T - 28 = 8 \\times 8 - 28 = 64 - 28 = 36\\)\n\nThus, the deal saves a customer 36 dollars.\n\n####\n36"}
{"question": "Diane is twice as old as her brother, Will. If Will was 4 years old 3 years ago, what will the sum of their ages be in 5 years?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) represent Will's current age and \\( D \\) represent Diane's current age. We are given that \\( D \\) is twice as old as \\( W \\), so we can express this relationship as \\( D = 2W \\).\n\nWe are also given that 3 years ago, Will was 4 years old, which means that \\( W - 3 = 4 \\). Solving this equation, we find that \\( W = 7 \\).\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation \\( D = 2W \\), we find that \\( D = 2 \\cdot 7 = 14 \\).\n\nTo find their ages in 5 years, we add 5 to each of their current ages. Will will be \\( W + 5 = 7 + 5 = 12 \\) years old, and Diane will be \\( D + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19 \\) years old.\n\nThe sum of their ages in 5 years will be \\( 12 + 19 = 31 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of their ages in 5 years will be 31. \n#### 31"}
