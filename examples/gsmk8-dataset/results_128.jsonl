{"question": "Brandon sold some geckos to a local pet shop. Brandon sold the geckos for 100$. The pet store sells them for 5 more than 3 times that. How much does the pet store profit?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the cost at which Brandon sold the geckos to the pet shop, and \\( S \\) represent the selling price at which the pet shop sells the geckos. The profit made by the pet shop is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = S - C \\]\n\nGiven that the selling price is 5 more than 3 times the cost at which Brandon sold the geckos, we can express \\( S \\) as \\( 5 + 3C \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (5 + 3C) - C \\]\n\nThis equation states that the profit made by the pet shop is the selling price \\( S \\) minus the cost \\( C \\) at which the geckos were purchased.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 100 \\) dollars (cost at which Brandon sold the geckos to the pet shop)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (5 + 3 \\times 100) - 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = (5 + 300) - 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 305 - 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 205 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pet store's profit from selling the geckos is $205.\n#### 205"}
