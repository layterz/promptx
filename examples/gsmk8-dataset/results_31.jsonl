{"question": "David and Brenda are playing Scrabble. Brenda is ahead by 22 points when she makes a 15-point play. David responds with a 32-point play. By how many points is Brenda now ahead?", "answer": "To determine how many points Brenda is ahead by after David's play, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Brenda is initially ahead by 22 points.\n2. Brenda makes a 15-point play, so her lead increases by 15 to become 22 + 15 = 37 points.\n3. David responds with a 32-point play. Since David's play reduces Brenda's lead, we subtract 32 points from Brenda's lead of 37 points.\n4. Therefore, Brenda is now ahead by 37 - 32 = 5 points. \n\n#### 5"}
