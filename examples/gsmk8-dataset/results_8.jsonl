{"question": "Jennifer purchased 40 cans of milk at the store before meeting her classmate Mark, who was also buying milk. Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. If Mark purchased 50 cans, how many cans of milk did Jennifer bring home from the store?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent the number of cans of milk Jennifer initially purchased, \\( M \\) represent the number of cans of milk Mark purchased, and \\( A \\) represent the total number of additional cans Jennifer purchased.\n\nAccording to the information given, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans Mark bought. This can be expressed as \\( A = \\frac{6}{5} M \\).\n\nGiven that Mark purchased 50 cans of milk, we can substitute \\( M \\) with 50 in the equation to find \\( A \\):\n\\[ A = \\frac{6}{5} \\times 50 = 60 \\]\n\nSo, Jennifer bought an additional 60 cans of milk.\n\nJennifer initially purchased 40 cans of milk, so the total number of cans she went home with is \\( J + A \\):\n\\[ J + A = 40 + 60 = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, Jennifer went home with 100 cans of milk from the store.\n####\n100"}
