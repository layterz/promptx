{"question": "Remi prepared a tomato nursery and planted tomato seedlings. After 20 days, the seedlings were ready to be transferred. On the first day, he planted 200 seedlings on the farm. On the second day, while working alongside his father, he planted twice the number of seedlings he planted on the first day. If the total number of seedlings transferred to the farm on these two days was 1200, how many seedlings did his father plant?", "answer": "Let \\( S_1 \\) represent the number of seedlings Remi planted on the first day, \\( S_2 \\) represent the number of seedlings Remi planted on the second day, and \\( S_f \\) represent the number of seedlings Remi's father planted. The total number of seedlings \\( S_t \\) transferred to the farm on the two days is given by:\n\n\\[ S_t = S_1 + S_2 + S_f \\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( S_1 = 200 \\) seedlings (seedlings planted on the first day)\n- \\( S_2 = 2 \\times S_1 = 400 \\) seedlings (seedlings planted on the second day, which is twice the seedlings planted on the first day)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S_t = 200 + 400 + S_f \\]\n\\[ S_t = 600 + S_f \\]\n\nSince the total number of seedlings transferred to the farm after the second day is 1200, we can write:\n\n\\[ 1200 = 600 + S_f \\]\n\nSolving for \\( S_f \\):\n\n\\[ S_f = 1200 - 600 \\]\n\\[ S_f = 600 \\]\n\nTherefore, Remi's father planted 600 seedlings. \n####\n600"}

{"question": "Carson is covering the high school football field with grass seed. Each square meter needs three times as much seed as fertilizer. If Carson uses 60 gallons of seed and fertilizer combined, how many gallons of seed does he use?", "answer": "Let \\( s \\) be the number of gallons of seed Carson uses and \\( f \\) be the number of gallons of fertilizer. We know that \\( s = 3f \\) and \\( s + f = 60 \\).\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation produces \\( 3f + f = 60 \\).\n\nCombining like terms, we get \\( 4f = 60 \\).\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get \\( f = 15 \\).\n\nSubstituting that value into the equation \\( s = 3f \\), we get \\( s = 3 \\times 15 = 45 \\).\n\nTherefore, Carson uses 45 gallons of seed.####\n45"}
