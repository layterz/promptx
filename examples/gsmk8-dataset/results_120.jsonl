{"question": "At the zoo, there are 5 different types of animals. Seeing each animal type takes around 6 minutes. How much time would it take to see each animal type if the zoo decided to import 4 new species?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of animal species at the zoo, and \\( M \\) represent the time it takes to see each animal type. The equation to calculate the time \\( M \\) to see each animal type if the zoo decides to import new species is given by:\n\n\\[ M = T \\times 6 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the time it takes (\\( M \\)) to see each animal type is the total number of animal species (\\( T \\)) multiplied by 6 minutes.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T = 5 \\) (current number of animal species at the zoo)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ M = 5 \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ M = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, if the zoo decides to import 4 new species, it would take 54 minutes to see each animal type.####\n54"}
{"question": "Agnes is 25 years old and her daughter, Jane is 6 years old.

We are trying to find the number of years, \\( x \\), after which Agnes will be twice as old as Jane. The equation to solve this is:\n\n\\[ A + x = 2(J + x) \\]\n\nThis equation states that Agnes's age after \\( x \\) years (\\( A + x \\)) will be twice Jane's age after \\( x \\) years (\\( 2(J + x) \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A = 25 \\) years (Agnes's current age)\n- \\( J = 6 \\) years (Jane's current age)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 25 + x = 2(6 + x) \\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 25 + x = 12 + 2x \\]\n\\[ x - 2x = 12 - 25 \\]\n\\[ -x = -13 \\]\n\\[ x = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, Agnes will be twice as old as Jane after 13 years.\n####\n13"}
{"question": "The American swallow can lift into the air and carry a maximum of 5 pounds of weight, while the European swallow can lift and carry twice the weight as the American swallow.  If there was a flock of 90 swallows, containing twice as many American as European swallows, what is the maximum combined weight the flock can carry?", "answer": "Let \\( x \\) represent the number of European swallows, and since the number of American swallows is twice the number of European swallows, the total number of swallows is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ 2x + x = 90 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ 3x = 90 \\]\n\n\\[ x = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the number of European swallows is 30, and the number of American swallows is \\( 90 - 30 = 60 \\).\n\nGiven that an American swallow can carry a maximum of 5 pounds and a European swallow can carry twice that weight, or 10 pounds, the maximum combined weight the flock can carry is calculated as:\n\n\\[ 30 \\text{ European swallows} \\times 10 \\text{ pounds} = 300 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\n\\[ 60 \\text{ American swallows} \\times 5 \\text{ pounds} = 300 \\text{ pounds} \\]\n\nTherefore, a flock of 90 birds, with 30 European swallows and 60 American swallows, can carry a maximum of 300 + 300 = 600 pounds. \n####\n600"}
