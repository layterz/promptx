{"question": "Nancy is filling an aquarium for her fish. She fills it halfway and goes to answer the door. While she's gone, her cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half the water in it. Then Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium. If the aquarium is 4 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 3 feet high, how many cubic feet of water are in the aquarium?", "answer": "Let \\(V\\) represent the volume of the aquarium.\nGiven that the aquarium has dimensions of 4 feet in length, 6 feet in width, and 3 feet in height, the volume can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[V = \\text{length} \\times \\text{width} \\times \\text{height}\\]\n\\[V = 4 \\times 6 \\times 3\\]\n\\[V = 72 \\text{ cubic feet}\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate the proportion of the aquarium that is full after the cat knocks it over. Since the aquarium was filled halfway before the cat knocked it over, the proportion of water remaining is \\(1/2\\).\nAfter Nancy refills the aquarium, she triples the amount of water. This means the proportion of the aquarium that is full is now \\(3/4\\) because \\(1/2\\) is reduced to \\(1/4\\) after the cat knocks it over and then multiplied by \\(3\\) when Nancy refills it.\n\nTo calculate the volume of water in the aquarium, multiply the proportion of the aquarium that is full by the volume of the aquarium:\n\n\\[ \\text{Volume of water} = V \\times \\text{Proportion of aquarium that is full}\\]\n\\[ \\text{Volume of water} = 72 \\times \\frac{3}{4}\\]\n\\[ \\text{Volume of water} = 54 \\text{ cubic feet}\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 54 cubic feet of water in the aquarium.\n####\n54"}
