{"question": "Janet bought some muffins at the bakery. Each muffin is 75 cents. Janet paid $20 and got $11 in change back. How many muffins did Janet buy?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the cost of the muffins and \\( M \\) represent the number of muffins bought. The equation to find the number of muffins bought is given by:\n\n\\[ C = M \\times P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the cost (\\( C \\)) of the muffins is equal to the number of muffins bought (\\( M \\)) multiplied by the price per muffin (\\( P \\)). \n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = \\$20 - \\$11 = \\$9 \\) (cost of the muffins, obtained by subtracting the amount paid from the change received)\n- \\( P = \\$0.75 \\) per muffin (price per muffin)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ \\$9 = M \\times \\$0.75 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( M \\), divide both sides of the equation by \\( \\$0.75 \\):\n\n\\[ M = \\frac{\\$9}{\\$0.75} \\]\n\nSimplifying,\n\n\\[ M = 12 \\]\n\nTherefore, Janet bought 12 muffins. \n####\n12"}
