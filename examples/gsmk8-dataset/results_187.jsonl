{"question": "In the beginning, Justine had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey but 2 fewer bands than Ylona. Bailey decided to give two bands each to Justine and Ylona so that he is left with only 8 rubber bands. How many rubber bands did Ylona have in the beginning?", "answer": "Let \\(J\\) represent the number of rubber bands Justine had in the beginning, \\(B\\) represent the number of rubber bands Bailey had in the beginning, and \\(Y\\) represent the number of rubber bands Ylona had in the beginning.\n\nGiven the information that Justine had 10 more rubber bands than Bailey, we can express this as \\(J = B + 10\\).\n\nAlso given the information that Justine had 2 fewer bands than Ylona, we can express this as \\(J = Y - 2\\).\n\nAnd given the information that Bailey gave 2 bands each to Justine and Ylona and was left with only 8 rubber bands, we have the equation \\(B - 2 - 2 = 8\\), which simplifies to \\(B - 4 = 8\\).\n\nSolving for \\(B\\) in the equation \\(B - 4 = 8\\), we find that \\(B = 12\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(B = 12\\) into the equation \\(J = B + 10\\), we find that \\(J = 22\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(J = 22\\) into the equation \\(J = Y - 2\\), we find that \\(Y = 24\\).\n\nTherefore, Ylona had 24 rubber bands in the beginning.\n####\n24"}
