The total number of stamps \\( Total \\) that Bella bought is given by:\n\n    \\[ Total = S + T + R \\]\n    \nGiven:\n- \\( S = 11 \\) snowflake stamps\n- \\( T = S + 9 \\) truck stamps (9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps)\n- \\( R = T - 13 \\) rose stamps (13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n    \n    \\[ Total = 11 + (S + 9) + ((S + 9) - 13) \\]\n    \\[ Total = 11 + (11 + 9) + ((11 + 9) - 13) \\]\n    \\[ Total = 38 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bella bought a total of 38 stamps.####\n38"}
{"question": "Each bird eats 12 beetles per day, each snake eats 3 birds per day, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. If there are 6 jaguars in a forest, how many beetles are eaten each day?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the number of beetles eaten per day, \\( S \\) represent the number of snakes eaten per day, and \\( J \\) represent the number of jaguars.\n\nGiven that each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day, we can express \\( S \\) as \\( 5J \\).\n\nGiven that each snake eats 3 birds per day, we can express \\( S \\) as \\( 3B \\).\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ S = 3B = 5J \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of birds eaten per day (\\( B \\)) multiplied by 3 is equal to the number of snakes eaten per day (\\( S \\)), which is also equal to the number of jaguars (\\( J \\)) multiplied by 5.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J = 6 \\) jaguars (number of jaguars in the forest)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 3B = 5 \ftimes 6 \\]\n\\[ S = 3B = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 30 snakes eaten per day.\n\nTo find the total number of birds eaten per day, we multiply the number of snakes by the number of birds per snake:\n\n\\[ B = S \ftimes 3 = 30 \ftimes 3 \\]\n\\[ B = 90 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 90 birds eaten per day.\n\nFinally, to find the total number of beetles eaten per day, we multiply the number of snakes by the number of beetles per snake:\n\n\\[ B = S \ftimes 12 = 90 \ftimes 12 \\]\n\\[ B = 1080 \\]\n\nTherefore, 1080 beetles are eaten each day.\n####\n1080"}
{"question": "Samantha\u2019s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie\u2019s last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie\u2019s. Jamie\u2019s full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha\u2019s last name?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the number of letters in Samantha's last name and \\( B \\) represent the number of letters in Bobbie's last name. The question states that Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name, so we can express \\( S \\) in terms of \\( B \\) as:\n\n\\[ S = B - 3 \\]\n\nThe question also states that if Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's. Jamie's last name is \"Grey\", which has 4 letters. So, Bobbie's last name is \\( 4 \\times 2 + 2 = 10 \\) letters long. Therefore, we can express \\( B \\) in terms of \\( S \\) as:\n\n\\[ B = S + 3 \\]\n\nNow we can substitute the value of \\( B \\) in terms of \\( S \\) into the equation for \\( S \\):\n\n\\[ S = (S + 3) - 3 \\]\n\\[ S = S \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of letters in Samantha's last name is the same as the number of letters in Samantha's last name. \n\nGiven:\n- Jamie's full name is \"Jamie Grey\", which has 4 letters.\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Samantha's last name has 7 letters.####\n7"}
