{"question": "Jackie walks 2 miles each day while Jessie walks 1.5 miles each day. How many more miles, in all, does Jackie walk than Jessie walk in 6 days?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent the number of miles Jackie walks each day, and \\( J \\) represent the number of miles Jessie walks each day. The equation to find the number of miles \\( M \\) Jackie walks more than Jessie in 6 days is given by:\n\n\\[ M = (J - J) \\times 6 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of miles Jackie walks more than Jessie (\\( M \\)) is the difference of the number of miles they each walk each day (\\( J - J \\)) multiplied by the number of days (6).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J = 2 \\) miles (miles Jackie walks each day)\n- \\( J = 1.5 \\) miles (miles Jessie walks each day)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ M = (2 - 1.5) \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ M = 0.5 \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ M = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, in 6 days, Jackie walks 3 miles more than Jessie. \n####\n3"}
