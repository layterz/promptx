The volume of air inhaled by Ross in \\( H \\) hours is given by:\n\n\\[ V = R \\cdot V_b \\cdot 60 \\cdot H \\]\n\nThis equation states that the volume of air inhaled (\\( V \\)) is equal to the rate of breaths per minute (\\( R \\)) multiplied by the volume of air inhaled in one breath (\\( V_b \\)), multiplied by 60 (to convert minutes to hours), and multiplied by the number of hours (\\( H \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( R = 17 \\) breaths per minute\n- \\( V_b = \\frac{5}{9} \\) liters per breath\n- \\( H = 24 \\) hours\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ V = 17 \\cdot \\frac{5}{9} \\cdot 60 \\cdot 24 \\]\n\\[ V = \\frac{122400}{9} \\]\n\\[ V = 13600 \\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of air inhaled by Ross in 24 hours is 13600 liters.\n####\n13600"}
{"question": "Caprice is taking piano lessons. Her mother pays the teacher $10 for every half-hour of teaching her daughter.
