{"question": "Leila spent $40 which is 1/4 of her money on a sweater. She was then left with $20 after spending the rest of her money on buying pieces of jewelry. How much more did Leila spend on jewelry than on the sweater?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) represent Leila's original amount of money, \\( S \\) represent the amount spent on a sweater, and \\( J \\) represent the amount spent on jewelry. The equation to find the difference in spending between the two is given by:\n\n\\[ J - S \\]\n\nSince Leila spent 1/4 of her money on a sweater, we can express \\( S \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{4}M \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ J - \\frac{1}{4}M \\]\n\nWe know that \\( M \\) is equal to the amount left after buying the sweater (\\$20) plus the amount spent on jewelry (\\$120). Therefore:\n\n\\[ M = \\$120 + \\$20 \\] \n\\[ M = \\$140 \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( M \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ J - \\frac{1}{4}(\\$140) \\]\n\nSimplifying further, we find:\n\n\\[ J - \\$35 \\]\n\nSince Leila is left with \\$20, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ J = \\$20 + \\$35 \\]\n\\[ J = \\$55 \\]\n\nFinally, we can calculate the difference in spending:\n\n\\[ J - S = \\$55 - \\$40 \\]\n\\[ J - S = \\$15 \\]\n\nTherefore, Leila spent \\$15 more on jewelry than on a sweater. \n####\n15"}
{"question": "James needs 40 fish to make one sushi roll. He goes to the market and buys 400 fish, but later finds out that 20% of the fish have gone bad and cannot be used.
