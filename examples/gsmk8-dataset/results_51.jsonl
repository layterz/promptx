{"question": "At a people counting station, the number of people counted on the first day was twice the total number counted on the second day. If 500 people were counted on the second day, how many people were counted on the two days?", "answer": "Let \\( P_1 \\) represent the number of people counted on the first day, and \\( P_2 \\) represent the number of people counted on the second day. The total number of people \\( P_T \\) counted on the two days is given by:\n\n\\[ P_T = P_1 + P_2 \\]\n\nSince \\( P_1 \\) is twice the number of people counted on the second day, we can express \\( P_1 \\) as \\( 2P_2 \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ P_T = 2P_2 + P_2 \\]\n\\[ P_T = 3P_2 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of people counted on the two days (\\( P_T \\)) is three times the number of people counted on the second day (\\( P_2 \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_2 = 500 \\) people (people counted on the second day)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ P_T = 3 \\times 500 \\]\n\\[ P_T = 1500 \\]\n\nTherefore, 1500 people were counted at the station on the two days.\n####\n1500"}
{"question": "Tropical Storm Sally brings 3 days of rain to southern Texas.  The first day it rained 4 inches.
