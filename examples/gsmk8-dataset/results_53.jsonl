{"question": "Bonnie and Samuel went to the market together. Bonnie bought 8 apples. Samuel bought 20 more apples than Bonnie. Samuel then ate half of them and used 1/7 of them to make apple pie. How many apples does Samuel have left?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the number of apples bought by Bonnie and \\( S \\) represent the number of apples bought by Samuel. The number of apples Samuel has left after eating and using some of them to make apple pie is given by:\n\n\\[ S_{left} = S - \\frac{S}{2} - \\frac{S}{7} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of apples Samuel has left (\\( S_{left} \\)) is the difference between the number of apples he bought (\\( S \\)) and the sum of half the number of apples he bought (\\( \\frac{S}{2} \\)) and one-seventh of the number of apples he bought (\\( \\frac{S}{7} \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = 8 \\) apples (number of apples bought by Bonnie)\n- \\( S = B + 20 = 28 \\) apples (number of apples bought by Samuel, which is 20 more than Bonnie)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S_{left} = 28 - \\frac{28}{2} - \\frac{28}{7} \\]\n\\[ S_{left} = 28 - 14 - 4 \\]\n\\[ S_{left} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Samuel has 10 apples left after eating and using some of them to make apple pie.\n####\n10"}
