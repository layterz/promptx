{"question": "Mr. Smith has incurred a 2% finance charge because he was not able to pay on time for his balance worth $150. If he plans to settle his balance today, how much will Mr. Smith pay?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the balance Mr. Smith needs to settle and \\( F \\) represent the finance charge. The total amount Mr. Smith needs to pay \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = B + F \\]\n\nIn this case, the finance charge is 2% of the balance. Therefore, we can express \\( F \\) as \\( \frac{2}{100} B \\). The equation becomes:\n\n\\[ T = B + \frac{2}{100} B \\]\n\\[ T = \\left( 1 + \frac{2}{100} \\right) B \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount Mr. Smith needs to pay (\\( T \\)) is equal to the sum of the balance (\\( B \\)) and the finance charge (\\( F \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B = \\$150 \\) (balance)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = \\left( 1 + \frac{2}{100} \\right) \\$150 \\]\n\\[ T = 1.02 \\$150 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$153 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. Smith needs to pay a total of $153 to settle his balance. \n#### \n153"}
