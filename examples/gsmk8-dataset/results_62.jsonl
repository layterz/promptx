{"question": "Crystal wanted to sell everything left in her pastry class before closing for the night.  She reduced her $3.00 cupcakes and her $2.00 cookies by half.  How much money did she make if she sold the last 16 cupcakes and 8 cookies?", "answer": "Let \\( P_C \\) represent the price of the cupcakes and \\( P_K \\) represent the price of the cookies. The total amount of money \\( M_T \\) made from selling cupcakes and cookies is given by:\n\n\\[ M_T = M_C + M_K \\]\n\nSince \\( P_C \\) and \\( P_K \\) are reduced by half, we can express the new prices \\( P'_C \\) and \\( P'_K \\) as \\( \t\\frac{1}{2} P_C \\) and \\( \t\\frac{1}{2} P_K \\) respectively. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ M_T = \t\\frac{1}{2} P_C \\times N_C + \t\\frac{1}{2} P_K \\times N_K \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total amount of money made \\( M_T \\) is equal to the sum of the product of the new price of cupcakes \\( P'_C \\) and the number of cupcakes sold \\( N_C \\), and the product of the new price of cookies \\( P'_K \\) and the number of cookies sold \\( N_K \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_C = \\$3.00 \\) (original price of cupcakes)\n- \\( P_K = \\$2.00 \\) (original price of cookies)\n- \\( N_C = 16 \\) (number of cupcakes sold)\n- \\( N_K = 8 \\) (number of cookies sold)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ M_T = \t\\frac{1}{2} \\$3.00 \\times 16 + \t\\frac{1}{2} \\$2.00 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ M_T = \\$1.50 \\times 16 + \\$1.00 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ M_T = \\$24.00 + \\$8.00 \\]\n\\[ M_T = \\$32.00 \\]\n\nTherefore, Crystal made a total of $32.00 from selling cupcakes and cookies..\n####\n32"}
{"question": "When Patrick, Manu, and Amy participate in a race they realize that Patrick finishes the race in 60 seconds. Manu took 12 more seconds to finish the race. If Amy is twice as fast as Manu, how long did it take her to finish the race?", "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to set up equations for each individual's race time and then use those equations to find the time for Amy to finish the race.\n\nLet \\( P \\) represent Patrick's time, \\( M \\) represent Manu's time, and \\( A \\) represent Amy's time.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 60 \\) seconds (Patrick's time)\n- \\( M = P + 12 \\) seconds (Manu's time, which is 12 seconds more than Patrick's time)\n- \\( A = \\frac{1}{2} M \\) seconds (Amy's time, which is half of Manu's time)\n\nWe can substitute the values of \\( P \\) and \\( M \\) into the equation for \\( A \\):\n\n\\( A = \\frac{1}{2} (P + 12) \\)\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\( A = \\frac{1}{2} P + 6 \\)\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of \\( P \\) into the equation for \\( A \\) and solve for \\( A \\):\n\n\\( A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 + 6 \\)\n\\( A = 30 + 6 \\)\n\\( A = 36 \\)\n\nTherefore, it took Amy 36 seconds to finish the race. #### 36"}

{"question": "Jude bought three chairs for his house, all at the same price. He also bought a table that costs $50 and two sets of plates at $20 for each set. After giving the cashier $130, Jude got a $4 change.

The total cost \\( Total \\) of the chairs, table, and plates is given by:\n\n\\[ Total = 3C + T + 2P \\]\n\nWe are given that the table costs $50 and each set of plates costs $20. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[ Total = 3C + 50 + 2 \\times 20 \\]\n\nWe are also given that Jude paid $130 and received a $4 change. So we can write another equation:\n\n\\[ Total + 4 = 130 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total cost plus the change is equal to the amount Jude paid.\n\nSubstituting the value of Total from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 3C + 50 + 2 \\times 20 + 4 = 130 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ 3C + 90 = 130 \\]\n\nSubtracting 90 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3C = 40 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{40}{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, each chair costs $40/3, or $<<40/3=13.33>>13.33 (rounded to two decimal places).\n\n#### 13.33"}
