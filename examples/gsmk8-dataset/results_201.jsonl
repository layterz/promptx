{"question": "Amon & Rhonda combined have 215 marbles. If Amon owns 55 marbles more than Rhonda, how many marbles does Rhonda have?", "answer": "Let's say Rhonda has \\(m\\) marbles.\n\nThe total number of marbles that Amon has is \\(m+55\\).\n\nAmon & Rhonda combined have \\(m+(m+55) = 215\\). \n\nThis means the total number of marbles they have together is \\(2m+55 = 215\\).\n\nTo find the number of marbles Rhonda has, we need to solve for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(2m=215-55\\) \n\nThe total number of marbles that Rhonda has is \\(m=160/2\\).\n\nTherefore, Rhonda has \\(m=80\\) marbles.\n\n#### 80"}
