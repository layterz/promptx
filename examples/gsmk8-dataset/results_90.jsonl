The equation relating these variables is given by:\n\n\\[ N \\times W \\times D = W \\]\n\nThis equation states that the product of the number of people, the weight of coal shoveled per person per day, and the number of days is equal to the total weight of coal shoveled.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( N = 10 \\) people\n- \\( W = 10,000 \\) pounds (total weight of coal shoveled)\n- \\( D = 10 \\) days\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\[ 10 \\times W \\times 10 = 10,000 \\]\n\\[ W = 1,000 \\] (weight of coal shoveled per day per 10 people)\n\nTo find the weight of coal shoveled per day per person (\\( W_p \\)), we divide the weight shoveled per day per 10 people by 10:\n\\[ W_p = \\frac{W}{N} = \\frac{1,000}{10} = 100 \\]\n\nTo find the number of days (\\( D' \\)) it will take for half of these ten people to shovel 40,000 pounds, we can use the equation:\n\\[ N \\times W_p \\times D' = 40,000 \\]\n\\[ 10 \\times 100 \\times D' = 40,000 \\]\n\\[ D' = \\frac{40,000}{1,000} \\]\n\\[ D' = 80 \\]\n\nTherefore, it will take half of these ten people 80 days to shovel 40,000 pounds of coal.\n####\n80"}
{"question": "Mikaela earns $10 an hour  tutoring. For the first month, she tutored for 35 hours and in the second month, she tutored 5 hours more than the first month. She spent 4/5 of her total earnings on her personal needs and saved the rest of the money. How much did she save?", "answer": "Let \\( E \\) represent Mikaela's earnings, \\( H_1 \\) represent the number of hours tutored in the first month, and \\( H_2 \\) represent the number of hours tutored in the second month. The equation to find Mikaela's total earnings \\( E_T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ E_T = (H_1 + H_2) \\times 10 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total earnings (\\( E_T \\)) is the sum of the number of hours tutored in the first and second month (\\( H_1 + H_2 \\)) multiplied by $10, which is the hourly rate.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( H_1 = 35 \\) hours (hours tutored in the first month)\n- \\( H_2 = H_1 + 5 = 40 \\) hours (hours tutored in the second month, which is 5 hours more than the first month)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ E_T = (35 + 40) \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ E_T = 75 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ E_T = 750 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mikaela earned a total of $750 for tutoring in the first two months.\n\nNext, let's calculate Mikaela's expenses.
