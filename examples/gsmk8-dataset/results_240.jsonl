{"question": "James writes a comic every other day for 4 years. If there was no leap year, how many comics has he written?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the total number of comics James has written and \\( D \\) represent the total number of days he has been writing comics. The equation to find the number of comics \\( C \\) James has written is given by:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{D}{2} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of comics (\\( C \\)) is half of the total number of days (\\( D \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D = 365 \\) days in a year * 4 years (total days in 4 years)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{365 \\times 4}{2} \\]\n\\[ C = \\frac{1460}{2} \\]\n\\[ C = 730 \\]\n\nTherefore, James has written a total of 730 comics."}
{"question": "Eric, Ben, and Jack have some money. Eric has $10 less than Ben, and Ben has $9 less than Jack. If Jack has $26, how much money, in dollars, do all 3 of them have in total?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent the amount of money Jack has, \\( B \\) represent the amount of money Ben has, and \\( E \\) represent the amount of money Eric has. \n\nGiven that Ben has $9 less than Jack (\\( B = J - 9 \\)) and Eric has $10 less than Ben (\\( E = B - 10 \\)), we can express the amount of money each person has in terms of Jack's amount, as follows:\n\n\\( B = J - 9 \\) \n\n\\( E = B - 10 \\) \n\nWe are also given that Jack has $26, so \\( J = 26 \\). \n\nSubstituting this value into the equations above, we can find the amounts of money for Ben and Eric:\n\n\\( B = 26 - 9 = 17 \\) \n\n\\( E = 17 - 10 = 7 \\) \n\nTo find the total amount of money all three have, we add up their individual amounts:\n\n\\( Total = J + B + E = 26 + 17 + 7 = 50 \\) \n\nTherefore, Eric, Ben, and Jack have a total of $50. \n#### \n50"}

{"question": "At the Mystic Aquarium, sharks are fed four buckets of fish each day. The dolphins are fed half as many buckets as the sharks while the other sea animals are fed five times as many buckets as the sharks. How many weeks will 546 buckets of fish last?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the number of buckets of fish fed to the sharks per day, \\( D \\) represent the number of buckets of fish fed to the dolphins per day, and \\( A \\) represent the number of buckets of fish fed to the other sea animals per day. The total number of buckets of fish fed per day \\( B_T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ B_T = S + D + A \\]\n\nSince the dolphins are fed half as many buckets of fish as the sharks, we can express \\( D \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2} S \\). And since the other sea animals are fed five times as many buckets of fish as the sharks, we can express \\( A \\) as \\( 5S \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ B_T = S + \\frac{1}{2} S + 5S \\]\n\\[ B_T = \\frac{11}{2} S \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of buckets of fish fed per day (\\( B_T \\)) is eleven halves times the number of buckets of fish fed to the sharks per day (\\( S \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B_T = 26 \\) buckets of fish per day (total buckets of fish fed per day)\n\nApplying the value to the equation:\n\n\\[ 26 = \\frac{11}{2} S \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( S \\), we can rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{26}{\\frac{11}{2}} = 26 \\times \\frac{2}{11} = 4.727 \\]\n\nSince it doesn't make sense to have a non-integer number of buckets, we can round down \\( S \\) to the nearest whole number:\n\n\\[ S = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the Mystic Aquarium feeds 4 buckets of fish to the sharks per day.\n\nTo find the number of weeks \\( W \\) that 546 buckets of fish will last, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{546}{B_T \\times 7} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B_T = 26 \\) buckets of fish per day (total buckets of fish fed per day)\n\nApplying the values to the formula:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{546}{26 \\times 7} \\]\n\\[ W = \\frac{546}{182} \\]\n\\[ W = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, 546 buckets of fish will last for 3 weeks. \n\n#### \n3"}

The total number of hoodies they own is given by:\n\n\\[ H + C = 8 \\]\n\nSince Casey owns two more hoodies than Fiona, we can express \\( C \\) as \\( H + 2 \\). Substituting this into the equation, we have:\n\n\\[ H + H + 2 = 8 \\]\n\\[ 2H + 2 = 8 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the sum of the number of hoodies Fiona owns (\\( H \\)) and the number of hoodies Casey owns (\\( C \\)) is equal to 8.\n\nGiven:\n- Casey owns 2 more hoodies than Fiona.\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ 2H + 2 = 8 \\]\n\\[ 2H = 8 - 2 \\]\n\\[ 2H = 6 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( H \\):\n\n\\[ H = \\frac{6}{2} \\]\n\\[ H = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, Fiona owns 3 hoodies.\n####\n3"}
{"question": "Yoque borrowed money from her sister. She promised to pay it back in 11 months including an additional 10% of the money she borrowed.

{"question": "A rancher owns a mixture of 8 sheep and 5 cattle that graze on his land.  In a typical year, the rancher will allow his animals to feed off his pastures for as long as possible before they run out of grass.  After the pastures run out of grass, he must buy feed corn for $10 per bag.  Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month, and each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month.  Additionally, a bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months.   If the rancher's pasture contains 144 acres of grass, how much will the rancher need to spend on feed corn to feed his animals each year?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the number of sheep and \\( C \\) represent the number of cattle owned by the rancher.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = 8 \\) (number of sheep)\n- \\( C = 5 \\) (number of cattle)\n- \\( T \\) (number of months the animals graze on the pasture before running out of grass)\n- \\( A = 144 \\) acres (total acres of grass in the pasture)\n- Each cow eats 2 acres of grass per month\n- Each sheep eats 1 acre of grass per month\n- Each bag of feed corn can feed each cow for 1 month and each sheep for 2 months\n- The rancher needs to find out how much he will need to spend on feed corn to feed his animals each year\n\nWe can start by finding \\( T \\) using the equation:\n\n\\[ 2CT + S = A \\]\n\nSince the rancher wants to know how much feed corn he needs to buy each year, let's first find the number of months the animals can graze on the pasture. Rearranging the equation, we have:\n\n\\[ T = (A - S) / (2C) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ T = (144 - 8) / (2 \\times 5) \\]\n\\[ T = 136 / 10 \\]\n\\[ T = 13.6 \\]\n\nThis means that the animals can graze on the pasture for 13.6 months.\n\nNext, we need to find the number of months for which the rancher needs to buy feed corn. Since there are 12 months in a year, the remaining months for which the animals need to be fed with feed corn is:\n\n\\[ R = 12 - T \\]\n\\[ R = 12 - 13.6 \\]\n\\[ R = -1.6 \\]\n\nSince it doesn't make sense to have negative months, we can assume that the animals will graze on the pasture for the entire year (12 months) and will need feed corn for 12 - 8 = 4 months.\n\nNext, let's calculate the number of bags of feed corn needed for the sheep:\n\n\\[ B_s = (S \\times R) / 2 \\]\n\\[ B_s = (8 \\times 4) / 2 \\]\n\\[ B_s = 32 / 2 \\]\n\\[ B_s = 16 \\]\n\nThis means that the rancher needs 16 bags of feed corn for the sheep.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of bags of feed corn needed for the cows:\n\n\\[ B_c = C \\times R \\]\n\\[ B_c = 5 \\times 4 \\]\n\\[ B_c = 20 \\]\n\nThis means that the rancher needs 20 bags of feed corn for the cows.\n\nTo find the total number of bags of feed corn needed, we can add the bags needed for the sheep and the bags needed for the cows:\n\n\\[ B_t = B_s + B_c \\]\n\\[ B_t = 16 + 20 \\]\n\\[ B_t = 36 \\]\n\nThis means that the rancher needs 36 bags of feed corn for all of his animals.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total cost of the feed corn:\n\n\\[ Cost = B_t \\times $10 \\]\n\\[ Cost = 36 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ Cost = $360 \\]\n\nTherefore, the rancher will need to spend $360 per year on feed corn. \n####\n360"}
