{"question": "Anna has a certain number of phone chargers and five times more laptop chargers than phone chargers. If she has 24 chargers total, how many phone chargers does she have?", "answer": "Let \\( p \\) be the number of phone chargers Anna has and \\( l \\) be the number of laptop chargers. We know that \\( l = 5p \\) and \\( l + p = 24 \\).\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get \\( 5p + p = 24 \\).\nCombining like terms, we get \\( 6p = 24 \\).\nDividing both sides of the equation by 6, we get \\( p = 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, Anna has 4 phone chargers.\n####\n4"}
