{"question": "Martin went to a store to buy a new television set. He decided to spend no more than $1,000 and the sales clerk offered him the TV for $100 less and an additional 20% off. How much lower was the price of the television than the amount Martin decided to spend?", "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to apply some algebraic equations.\n\nLet \\( P \\) be the price of the television set that Martin decided to spend, \\( D \\) be the discount offered by the sales clerk, and \\( F \\) be the final price of the television after the discount.\n\nGiven that the sales clerk offered the TV for \\( $100 \\) less than the price Martin decided to spend, we can write:\n\n\\[ F = P - 100 \\]\n\nGiven that there is an additional \\( 20\\% \\) discount on the television, we can represent the discount as a percentage of the final price:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{20}{100} \\times F \\]\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( F \\) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{20}{100} \\times (P - 100) \\]\n\nTo find the final price of the television, we subtract the discount from the original price:\n\n\\[ F = P - D \\]\n\\[ F = P - \\frac{20}{100} \\times (P - 100) \\]\n\nFinally, to find how much lower the price of the television is compared to what Martin decided to spend, we subtract the final price from the original price:\n\n\\[ \\text{Lower price} = P - F \\]\n\nNow, let's apply these equations to the given values.\n\nGiven:\n- The original price \\( P \\) = $1000\n\nSubstituting this value into the equation for \\( F \\):\n\\[ F = 1000 - \\frac{20}{100} \\times (1000 - 100) \\]\n\\[ F = 1000 - \\frac{20}{100} \\times 900 \\]\n\\[ F = 1000 - 180 \\]\n\\[ F = 820 \\]\n\nNow substituting the values of \\( P \\) and \\( F \\) into the equation for the lower price:\n\\[ \\text{Lower price} = 1000 - 820 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Lower price} = 180 \\]\n\nTherefore, the price of the television is $280 lower than Martin decided to spend.\n\n#### 280"}
{"question": "Steve has 25 socks. He has 4 pairs of socks that match, and all the others don't match. How many mismatching socks does Steve have altogether?", "answer": "Let \\( S \\) represent the total number of socks Steve has, and \\( P_m \\) represent the number of pairs of matching socks. The total number of mismatching socks \\( S_m \\) Steve has can be found using the equation:\n\n\\[ S_m = S - P_m \\times 2 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of mismatching socks (\\( S_m \\)) is equal to the total number of socks (\\( S \\)) minus the number of pairs of matching socks (\\( P_m \\)) multiplied by 2 (since each pair contains 2 matching socks).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S = 25 \\) (total number of socks)\n- \\( P_m = 4 \\) (number of pairs of matching socks)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S_m = 25 - 4 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ S_m = 25 - 8 \\]\n\\[ S_m = 17 \\]\n\nTherefore, Steve has a total of 17 mismatching socks. \n####\n17"}
