{"question": "James buys jars for his honey.  He has 5 hives that each produce 20 liters of honey.  Each jar can hold .5 liters.  How many jars will he need to buy if his friend is bringing his own jars for half the honey?", "answer": "Let \\( H \\) represent the total amount of honey produced, \\( H_{hive} \\) represent the amount of honey produced by each hive, and \\( J \\) represent the number of jars needed. The equation to find the number of jars needed is given by:\n\n\\[ J = \\frac{{H - \\frac{1}{2}H}}{{0.5}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of jars needed (\\( J \\)) is the difference between the total amount of honey produced (\\( H \\)) and half the amount of honey (\\( \\frac{1}{2}H \\)), divided by the capacity of each jar (0.5 liters).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( H_{hive} = 20 \\) liters (amount of honey produced by each hive)\n- There are 5 hives (total hives)\n- His friend is bringing his own jars for half the honey\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ H = H_{hive} \\times \\text{total hives} \\]\n\\[ H = 20 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ H = 100 \\text{ liters} \\]\n\n\\[ J = \\frac{{100 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100}}{{0.5}} \\]\n\\[ J = \\frac{{100 - 50}}{{0.5}} \\]\n\\[ J = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, James will need to buy 100 jars. \n####\n100"}
{"question": "Susan earned $600 from babysitting over the summer. She went shopping and spent half of it on clothes. Then she spent half of what was left on books.
