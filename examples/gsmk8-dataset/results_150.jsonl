{"question": "Marco owns an ice cream truck.  His ice cream cones are $5 each.  If his expenses are 80% of total sales for the day, how many ice cream cones would he need to sell to make a $200 profit for the day?", "answer": "Let \\( C \\) represent the number of ice cream cones Marco sells in a day, and \\( P \\) represent the profit made in a day. \nThe equation to find the number of ice cream cones \\( C_R \\) Marco needs to sell to make a profit \\( P_R \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ C_R = \\frac{{P_R}}{{\\frac{{1}}{{5}}}} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of ice cream cones Marco needs to sell (\\( C_R \\)) to make a profit (\\( P_R \\)) is equal to the profit divided by \\( \\frac{{1}}{{5}} \\), which represents the profit fraction.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P_R = 200 \\) (desired profit for the day)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\\[ C_R = \\frac{{ 200 }}{{ \\frac{{1}}{{5}} }} \\]\n\\[ C_R = 200 \\times \\frac{{5}}{{1}} \\]\n\\[ C_R = 200 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ C_R = 1000 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marco needs to sell 1000 ice cream cones to make a $200 profit for the day."}
{"question": "Gabby planted a watermelon vine, a peach tree, and two plum trees in the spring. Over the summer, the plants grew and produced fruit.
