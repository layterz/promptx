{"question": "The gauge on a water tank shows that the tank is 1/3 full of water. To fill the tank, 16 gallons of water are added. How many gallons of water does the tank hold when full?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total capacity of the water tank.\n\nGiven that the tank is 1/3 full of water, and that it requires 16 gallons to fill, we can determine the capacity of the tank as follows:\n\n1. The empty portion of the tank is equal to 2/3 of the tank's total capacity (\\( \\frac{2}{3}T \\)).\n2. Since it takes 16 gallons to fill this empty portion, we can set up the equation \\( \\frac{2}{3}T = 16 \\).\n3. Solve for \\( T \\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}T = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 16 \\]\n\\[ T = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, the water tank has a total capacity of 24 gallons.\n####\n24"}
