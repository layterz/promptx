{"question": "Alexander Bought 22 more joggers than Tyson. Christopher bought twenty times as many joggers as Tyson. If Christopher bought 80 joggers, how many more joggers does Christopher buy than Alexander?", "answer": "To solve the problem, we can assign variables to the number of joggers bought by each person. Let \\( T \\) represent the number of joggers bought by Tyson, \\( A \\) represent the number of joggers bought by Alexander, and \\( C \\) represent the number of joggers bought by Christopher.\n\nGiven:\n- Christopher bought twenty times as many joggers as Tyson, so \\( C = 20T \\).\n- Alexander bought 22 more joggers than Tyson, so \\( A = T + 22 \\).\n- Christopher bought 80 joggers, so \\( C = 80 \\).\n\nSubstituting the value of \\( C \\) in terms of \\( T \\) into the equation for \\( A \\):\n\\[ A = T + 22 \\]\n\\[ 80 = 20T + 22 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ 20T = 80 - 22 \\]\n\\[ 20T = 58 \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{58}{20} \\]\n\\[ T = 2.9 \\]\n\nSince Tyson bought 4 joggers, which is not a whole number, this contradicts the given information. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or calculations. Please double-check the question and answer."}
