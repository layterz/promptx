{"question": "Every 4 weeks, Helen hand washes her silk pillowcases.  It takes 30 minutes to hand wash all of them.  In 1 year, how much time does Helen spend hand washing her pillowcases?", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) be the number of weeks Helen hand washes her silk pillowcases, \\( T \\) be the total time it takes her to hand wash them, and \\( Y \\) be the total number of years she hand washes them. The equation to find the total time \\( T_y \\) Helen spends hand washing her pillowcases in a year is given by:\n\n\\[ T_y = T \\times Y \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total time Helen spends hand washing her pillowcases in a year (\\( T_y \\)) is the product of the time it takes her to wash them (\\( T \\)) and the total number of years (\\( Y \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W = 4 \\) weeks (hand washes every 4 weeks)\n- \\( Y = 1 \\) year (total number of years)\n- \\( T = 30 \\) minutes (time it takes to hand wash all the pillowcases)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T_y = 30 \times 1 \\]\n\\[ T_y = 30 \\]\n\nTherefore, Helen spends a total of 30 minutes hand washing her pillowcases in a year.\n####\n30"}
