{"question": "Mr. John works at a shopping mall and receives a monthly income of $2000, but he spends approximately 5% of this amount on public transport to and from the mall in a month. How much will he have left after deducting his monthly transport fare from his income?", "answer": "Let \\( I \\) represent Mr. John's monthly income and \\( F \\) represent his monthly transport fare. The equation to find the amount Mr. John will have left after deducting his transport fare is given by:\n\n\\[ I - F \\]\n\nThis equation simply subtracts the transport fare (\\( F \\)) from the monthly income (\\( I \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( I = \\$2000 \\) (monthly income)\n- The transport fare is \\( 5\\% \\) of the monthly income\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ I - F = \\$2000 - 5\\% \\times \\$2000 \\]\n\\[ I - F = \\$2000 - \\frac{5}{100} \\times \\$2000 \\]\n\\[ I - F = \\$2000 - \\$100 \\]\n\\[ I - F = \\$1900 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mr. John will have \\$1900 left after deducting his monthly transport fare from his income.\n####\n1900"}
