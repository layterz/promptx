{"question": "Toby is making toast and adding peanut butter to it. He wants to make sure he has 500 calories for breakfast. A piece of bread has 100 calories. A serving of peanut butter has 200 calories. If he has one piece of bread, how many servings of peanut butter should he add?", "answer": "Let \\( C_T \\) represent the total number of calories for breakfast, \\( C_B \\) represent the number of calories in a piece of bread, and \\( C_P \\) represent the number of calories in a serving of peanut butter. The equation to find the number of servings of peanut butter \\( S_P \\) needed is given by:\n\n\\[ C_T = C_B + S_P \\times C_P \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of calories for breakfast (\\( C_T \\)) is equal to the number of calories in a piece of bread (\\( C_B \\)) plus the number of servings of peanut butter (\\( S_P \\)) multiplied by the number of calories in each serving of peanut butter (\\( C_P \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C_T = 500 \\) calories (total number of calories for breakfast)\n- \\( C_B = 100 \\) calories (calories in a piece of bread)\n- \\( C_P = 200 \\) calories (calories in a serving of peanut butter)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_T = C_B + S_P \\times C_P \\]\n\\[ 500 = 100 + S_P \\times 200 \\]\n\nTo find \\( S_P \\), we can start by subtracting \\( C_B \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 500 - 100 = S_P \\times 200 \\]\n\\[ 400 = S_P \\times 200 \\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by \\( C_P \\):\n\\[ \frac{400}{200} = S_P \\times \frac{200}{200} \\]\n\\[ 2 = S_P \\]\n\nTherefore, Toby should add 2 servings of peanut butter.####\n2"}
{"question": "Mary's sheep can run 12 feet per second, and her sheepdog can run 20 feet per second. A sheep standing 160 feet away from the sheep dog bolts, and the dog runs after it.

Let \\( D_T \\) be the time it takes for the dog to catch the sheep. \n\nThe speed difference between the dog and the sheep is given by: \n\n\\[ D - S \\]\n\nIn this case, the speed of the sheep is 12 feet per second, and the speed of the dog is 20 feet per second. \n\nTherefore, the speed difference is: \n\n\\[ D - S = 20 \\, \\text{feet/second} - 12 \\, \\text{feet/second} = 8 \\, \\text{feet/second} \\]\n\nTo find the time it takes for the dog to catch the sheep, we divide the distance the dog needs to run by the speed difference:\n\n\\[ D_T = \\frac{{\\text{distance}}}{{\\text{speed difference}}} \\]\n\nIn this case, the distance the dog needs to run is 160 feet. \n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the dog to catch the sheep is:\n\n\\[ D_T = \\frac{{160 \\, \\text{feet}}}{{8 \\, \\text{feet/second}}} = 20 \\, \\text{seconds} \\]\n\nTherefore, it takes the dog 20 seconds to catch the sheep. \n#### 20"}
