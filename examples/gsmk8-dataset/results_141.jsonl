{"question": "Brittany got a 78 on her first test. After her second test, her average rose to an 81. What grade did she get on her second test?", "answer": "Let \\( G_1 \\) represent the grade Brittany got on her first test, \\( G_2 \\) represent the grade Brittany got on her second test, and \\( Avg \\) represent her average grade.\n\nWe can use the formula for finding the average to solve for \\( G_2 \\):\n\n\\[ Avg = \\frac{G_1 + G_2}{2} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( G_1 = 78 \\) (grade on her first test)\n- \\( Avg = 81 \\) (average grade after her second test)\n\nApplying the values to the formula:\n\n\\[ 81 = \\frac{78 + G_2}{2} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( G_2 \\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 81 = 78 + G_2 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ 162 = 78 + G_2 \\]\n\nSubtracting 78 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ G_2 = 162 - 78 \\]\n\nTherefore, Brittany got a grade of 84 on her second test."}

{"question": "Eliza can iron a blouse in 15 minutes and a dress in 20 minutes.  If she spends 2 hours ironing blouses and 3 hours ironing dresses, how many pieces of clothes did she iron?", "answer": "Let \\( B \\) represent the number of blouses ironed by Eliza and \\( D \\) represent the number of dresses ironed by Eliza. The total number of pieces of clothes \\( T \\) ironed by Eliza is given by:\n\n\\[ T = B + D \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Eliza spends 2 hours, which is equal to 2 x 60 = 120 minutes, ironing blouses. Since it takes 15 minutes to iron one blouse, the number of blouses ironed is 120 / 15 = 8.\n- Eliza spends 3 hours, which is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes, ironing dresses. Since it takes 20 minutes to iron one dress, the number of dresses ironed is 180 / 20 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the total number of pieces of clothes ironed by Eliza is 8 + 9 = 17.\n\n#### \n17"}
{"question": "Jennifer bought twice as many candies as Emily and three times as many as Bob bought. If Emily bought 6 candies, how many candies did Bob buy?", "answer": "Let \\( J \\) represent the number of candies Jennifer bought, \\( E \\) represent the number of candies Emily bought, and \\( B \\) represent the number of candies Bob bought. \n\nThe relationship between their purchases can be described as:\n\n\\[ J = 2E \\] (Jennifer bought twice as many candies as Emily)\n\n\\[ J = 3B \\] (Jennifer bought three times as many candies as Bob)\n\nWe are given that Emily bought 6 candies. Therefore, we can find the number of candies Jennifer bought by substituting \\( E = 6 \\) into the equation \\( J = 2E \\):\n\n\\[ J = 2 \\times 6 \\]\n\\[ J = 12 \\]\n\nSince Jennifer bought 12 candies and that is three times as much as Bob bought, we can set up the equation \\( 3B = 12 \\) to find the number of candies Bob bought:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{12}{3} \\]\n\\[ B = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, Bob bought 4 candies.\n####\n4"}
{"question": "Maria is baking cookies for Sally.
