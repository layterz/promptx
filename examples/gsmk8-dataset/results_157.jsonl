{"question": "Peter and Kristin are to read 20 fantasy novels each in a week. Peter can read three times as fast as Kristin. If Peter reads one book in 18 hours, how long will Kristin read half of her books?", "answer": "Let \\( P \\) represent the time it takes for Peter to read one book and \\( K \\) represent the time it takes for Kristin to read one book. The equation to find the time \\( T \\) it will take for Kristin to read half of her books is given by:\n\n\\[ T = K \\times \\text{number of books} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the time (\\( T \\)) it will take for Kristin to read half of her books is equal to the time it takes for Kristin to read one book (\\( K \\)) multiplied by the number of books she needs to read.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 18 \\) hours (time it takes for Peter to read one book)\n- \\( P = 3 \\times K \\) (Peter reads three times as fast as Kristin)\n- \\( \\text{number of books} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\) books (Kristin needs to read half of her books)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = K \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ T = K \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times 3 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{3} \\times K \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{3} \\times P \\times 30 \\]\n\nSince we know that \\( P = 18 \\) hours:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 18 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ T = 540 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kristin will take 540 hours to read half of her books. \n####\n540"}
{"question": "There are 6 times as many lab coats as uniforms in the lab. The number of lab techs is half of the number of uniforms. If there are 12 uniforms in the lab, and the lab techs share the coats and uniforms equally among them, how many coats and uniforms in total does each lab tech get?", "answer": "Let \\( U \\) represent the number of uniforms in the lab, \\( L \\) represent the number of lab coats, and \\( LT \\) represent the number of lab techs. The total number of lab coats and uniforms \\( T \\) in the lab is given by:\n\n\\[ T = L + U \\]\n\nSince there are 6 times as many lab coats as uniforms, we can express \\( L \\) as \\( 6U \\).
