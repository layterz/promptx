{"question": "Jamie is a firefighter. One day an emergency call comes in from Mrs. Thompson, an elderly woman whose cat can't get down a 20-foot tree. The last time Jamie rescued a cat, he got it down from a 6-foot tree and had to climb 12 rungs of his ladder. How many rungs does he have to climb this time to get the cat down from the tree?", "answer": "Let \\( R_f \\) represent the number of rungs Jamie needs to climb to get the cat down from the tree. \n\nWe are given the following information:\n- Jamie needed 2 rungs per foot of the tree to save the first cat.\n- Jamie climbed 12 rungs to save the cat from a 6-foot tree.\n\nTo find the number of rungs \\( R_f \\) needed to climb a 20-foot tree, we can use the ratio of rungs per foot:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{{\\text{{rungs}}}}{{\\text{{feet}}}} = \\frac{{12}}{{6}} = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of rungs \\( R_f \\) needed to climb a 20-foot tree is:\n\n\\[\nR_f = 20 \\times 2 = 40\n\\]\n\nJamie needs to climb 40 rungs to get the cat down from the tree.\n#### 40"}
{"question": "Sanya can wash 7 bath towels in one wash, which will take 1 hour.  She only has 2 hours in a day to do this task.

{"question": "Ten more than twice the number of birds on the fence is 50. How many birds are on the fence?", "answer": "Let \\( x \\) represent the number of birds on the fence. \n\nWe know that ten more than twice the number of birds on the fence is 50. \n\nSo we can set up the equation: \n\n\\[ 10 + 2x = 50 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we need to isolate \\( x \\) on one side of the equation. \n\nSubtracting 10 from both sides, we get: \n\n\\[ 2x = 50 - 10 = 40 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get: \n\n\\[ x = \\frac{40}{2} = 20 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 20 birds on the fence.\n\n#### \n20"}
