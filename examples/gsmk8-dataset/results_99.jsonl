{"question": "Percy wants to save up for a new PlayStation, which costs $500. He gets $200 on his birthday and $150 at Christmas. To make the rest of the money, he's going to sell his old PlayStation games for $7.5 each. How many games does he need to sell to reach his goal?", "answer": "Let's assume:\n- \\(T\\) is the target amount of money to be saved (\\$500)\n- \\(M_b\\) is the amount of money Percy gets on his birthday (\\$200)\n- \\(M_c\\) is the amount of money Percy gets at Christmas (\\$150)\n- \\(P\\) is the price of one PlayStation game (\\$7.5)\n- \\(G\\) is the number of games Percy needs to sell to reach his goal\n\nTo find the number of games Percy needs to sell, we can use the equation:\n\n\\[ T = M_b + M_c + P \\times G \\]\n\nThis equation states that the target amount of money to be saved (\\(T\\)) is equal to the sum of the amount of money Percy gets on his birthday (\\(M_b\\)), the amount of money Percy gets at Christmas (\\(M_c\\)), and the product of the price of one PlayStation game (\\(P\\)) and the number of games Percy needs to sell (\\(G\\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(T = \\$500\\) (target amount of money to be saved)\n- \\(M_b = \\$200\\) (amount of money Percy gets on his birthday)\n- \\(M_c = \\$150\\) (amount of money Percy gets at Christmas)\n- \\(P = \\$7.5\\) (price of one PlayStation game)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ \\$500 = \\$200 + \\$150 + \\$7.5 \\times G \\]\n\\[ \\$150 = \\$7.5 \\times G \\]\n\nTo find the number of games (\\(G\\)), we need to divide both sides of the equation by \\$7.5:\n\n\\[ \\frac{\\$150}{\\$7.5} = \\frac{\\$7.5 \\times G}{\\$7.5} \\]\n\\[ 20 = G \\]\n\nTherefore, Percy needs to sell 20 games to reach his goal of saving \\$500.\n####\n20"}
