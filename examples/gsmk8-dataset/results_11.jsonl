{"question": "Marvin and Tina were selling candy bars to help fund their class trip.  The candy bars cost $2 each.  Marvin sold 35 candy bars total.  Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin.  How much more money did Tina make for the class trip selling candy bars compared to Marvin?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) represent the number of candy bars Marvin sold and \\( T \\) represent the number of candy bars Tina sold. The amount of money \\( A_M \\) Marvin made selling candy bars is given by:\n\n\\[ A_M = M \\times 2 \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount of money Marvin made selling candy bars (\\( A_M \\)) is the number of candy bars Marvin sold (\\( M \\)) multiplied by the price of each candy bar (2 dollars).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( M = 35 \\) candy bars (candy bars sold by Marvin)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ A_M = 35 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ A_M = 70 \\]\n\nTherefore, Marvin made 70 dollars selling candy bars.\n\nSince Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin, we can express \\( T \\) as \\( 3M \\). The amount of money \\( A_T \\) Tina made selling candy bars is given by:\n\n\\[ A_T = T \\times 2 \\]\n\nApplying the value of \\( T \\):\n\n\\[ A_T = 3M \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ A_T = 6M \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Tina made selling candy bars is 6 times the amount Marvin made.\n\nTo calculate the difference in the amount of money Tina made compared to Marvin, we subtract the amount Marvin made from the amount Tina made:\n\n\\[ A_T - A_M = 6M - 2M \\]\n\\[ A_T - A_M = 4M \\]\n\nGiven that \\( M = 35 \\), we can substitute it into the equation:\n\n\\[ A_T - A_M = 4 \\times 35 \\]\n\\[ A_T - A_M = 140 \\]\n\nTherefore, Tina made 140 dollars more for the class trip selling candy bars compared to Marvin.\n####\n140"}
