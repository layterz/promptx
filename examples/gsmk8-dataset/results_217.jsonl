{"question": "Bill and Jean are both cleaning out their garages. Bill makes a certain number of trips to the dump and Jean makes that many trips plus 6. If they make 40 trips total, how many trips does Jean make?", "answer": "Let \\( b \\) represent the number of trips Bill makes and \\( j \\) represent the number of trips Jean makes. \n\nWe are given the following information:\n- \\( b + j = 40 \\) (the total number of trips they make is 40)\n- \\( j = b + 6 \\) (Jean makes that many trips plus 6)\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\\( b + b + 6 = 40 \\)\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\( 2b + 6 = 40 \\)\n\nSubtracting 6 from both sides, we get:\n\\( 2b = 34 \\)\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\\( b = 17 \\)\n\nSubstituting that value back into \\( j = b + 6 \\), we get:\n\\( j = 17 + 6 = 23 \\)\n\nTherefore, Jean makes 23 trips.####\n23"}
{"question": "The show Magic King was on the air for 10 seasons and 20 episodes per season for the first half of seasons and 25 for the second half of the show.

The equation to find the total number of calories burned \\( C_T \\) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ C_T = H \\times C_H \\]\n\nThis equation states the total number of calories burned (\\( C_T \\)) is equal to the number of hours Jonah ran (\\( H \\)) multiplied by the number of calories burnt per hour (\\( C_H \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( H = 2 \\) hours (hours Jonah ran)\n- \\( C_H = 30 \\) calories (calories Jonah burnt per hour)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_T = 2 \\times 30 \\]\n\\[ C_T = 60 \\]\n\nTherefore, when Jonah ran for 2 hours, burning 30 calories every hour, he burned a total of 60 calories.\nIf he had run for five hours, losing 30 calories every hour, Jonah would have burnt 5*30=150 calories.\nThe difference in the number of calories Jonah would have burnt if he ran for five hours instead of 2 hours is 150-60=90 calories.\n####\n90"}
