{"question": "Damien collects glasses for a hobby and decides he wants to put them in display cupboards. His tall cupboard can hold 20 glasses, his wide cupboard can hold twice as many, and his narrow cupboard can hold 15 glasses with the glasses divided equally among the three shelves. As Damien is putting glasses in the narrow cupboard, he accidentally breaks one of the shelves. If all of the cupboards are full, how many glasses are currently being displayed?", "answer": "Let \\(T\\) represent the number of glasses that can be held in the tall cupboard, \\(W\\) represent the number of glasses that can be held in the wide cupboard, and \\(N\\) represent the number of glasses that can be held in the narrow cupboard. The total number of glasses currently being displayed, \\(D\\), can be calculated as:\n\n\\[D = T + W + N\\]\n\nGiven:\n- The tall cupboard can hold 20 glasses, so \\(T = 20\\) glasses.\n- The wide cupboard can hold twice as many glasses as the tall cupboard, so \\(W = 2 \\times T = 2 \\times 20 = 40\\) glasses.\n- The narrow cupboard can hold 15 glasses divided equally among the three shelves, so each shelf can hold \\(15/3 = 5\\) glasses. Therefore, \\(N = 15\\) glasses.\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[D = 20 + 40 + 15 = 75\\]\n\nTherefore, there are currently 75 glasses being displayed. \n####\n75"}
