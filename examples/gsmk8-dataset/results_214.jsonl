{"question": "Mark is buying asphalt to pave a new section of road. The road will be 2000 feet long and 20 feet wide. Each truckload of asphalt will cover 800 square feet of road. If each truckload costs $75, and there's a 20% sales tax, how much will Mark need to pay for asphalt?", "answer": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nGiven:\n- Length of the road = 2000 feet\n- Width of the road = 20 feet\n- Area covered by each truckload of asphalt = 800 square feet\n- Cost per truckload = $75\n- Sales tax = 20%\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total square footage of road that Mark needs to cover. This can be done by multiplying the length by the width:\n\nLet \\( L \\) be the length of the road, and \\( W \\) be the width of the road. The total square footage of road \\( A \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ A = L \\times W \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ A = 2000 \\, \\text{feet} \\times 20 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\\[ A = 40000 \\, \\text{square feet} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of truckloads of asphalt Mark needs. This can be done by dividing the square footage of road by the area covered by each truckload:\n\nLet \\( T \\) be the number of truckloads, and \\( C \\) be the area covered by each truckload. The equation to find the number of truckloads \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{A}{C} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{40000 \\, \\text{square feet}}{800 \\, \\text{square feet/truckload}} \\]\n\\[ T = 50 \\, \\text{truckloads} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total cost of the asphalt. This can be done by multiplying the number of truckloads by the cost per truckload:\n\nLet \\( P \\) be the total cost of the asphalt, \\( C_p \\) be the cost per truckload, and \\( T \\) be the number of truckloads. The equation to find the total cost \\( P \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ P = C_p \\times T \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ P = $75 \\, \\text{per truckload} \\times 50 \\, \\text{truckloads} \\]\n\\[ P = $3750 \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the sales tax on the cost of the asphalt. This can be done by multiplying the total cost by the sales tax rate:\n\nLet \\( S \\) be the sales tax, \\( P \\) be the total cost, and \\( R \\) be the sales tax rate. The equation to find the sales tax \\( S \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ S = P \\times R \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ S = $3750 \\times 0.2 \\]\n\\[ S = $750 \\]\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the total amount Mark needs to pay. This can be done by adding the sales tax to the cost of the asphalt:\n\nLet \\( T \\) be the total amount Mark needs to pay, \\( P \\) be the total cost, and \\( S \\) be the sales tax. The equation to find the total amount \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ T = P + S \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ T = $3750 + $750 \\]\n\\[ T = $4500 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mark needs to pay $4500 for the asphalt. #### 4500"}
