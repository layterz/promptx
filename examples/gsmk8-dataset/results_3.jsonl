{"question": "Ann, Bill, Cate, and Dale each buy personal pan pizzas cut into 4 pieces. If Bill and Dale eat 50% of their pizzas and Ann and Cate eat 75% of the pizzas, how many pizza pieces are left uneaten?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent the total number of pizza pieces. \n\nGiven that there are 4 people and each person has a personal pan pizza cut into 4 pieces, the total number of pizza pieces \\( T \\) is:\n\n\\[ T = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\]\n\nNow let's calculate the number of pizza pieces eaten by each person. \n\nBill and Dale each eat 50% of their pizzas, which is \\( 2 \\times 4 \\times 50\\% = 4 \\) pieces. \n\nAnn and Cate each eat 75% of their pizzas, which is \\( 2 \\times 4 \\times 75\\% = 6 \\) pieces.\n\nTherefore, the four of them eat a total of \\( 4 + 6 = 10 \\) pieces.\n\nTo find the number of pizza pieces uneaten, subtract the number of pieces eaten from the total number of pizza pieces:\n\n\\[ T - 10 = 16 - 10 = 6 \\]\n\nTherefore, there are 6 pizza pieces left uneaten. \n####\n6"}

The total sales \\( T \\) for the month can be calculated using the following equation:\n\n\\[ T = (L \\times P_L) + (S \\times P_S) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( L = 8 \\) large paintings sold\n- \\( S = 4 \\) small paintings sold\n- \\( P_L = \\$60 \\) price of a large painting\n- \\( P_S = \\$30 \\) price of a small painting\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ T = (8 \\times \\$60) + (4 \\times \\$30) \\]\n\\[ T = \\$480 + \\$120 \\]\n\\[ T = \\$600 \\]\n\nTherefore, Noah's total sales for last month were \\$600.\n\nTo find out his sales for this month, we can multiply his total sales last month by 2:\n\n\\[ T_{\\text{this month}} = \\$600 \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ T_{\\text{this month}} = \\$1200 \\]\n\nTherefore, Noah's sales for this month amount to \\$1200.\n####\n1200"}
{"question": "A car is driving through a tunnel with many turns. After a while, the car must travel through a ring that requires a total of 4 right-hand turns. After the 1st turn, it travels 5 meters. After the 2nd turn, it travels 8 meters. After the 3rd turn, it travels a little further and at the 4th turn, it immediately exits the tunnel.

We are given that the sum of these distances is 23 meters.\n\n\\(D_1\\) is 5 meters,\n\\(D_2\\) is 8 meters,\nand \\(D_4\\) is 0 meters.\n\nTo determine the distance traveled after the 3rd turn (\\(D_3\\)), we can subtract the sum of \\(D_1\\), \\(D_2\\), and \\(D_4\\) from the total distance (23 meters).\n\nTherefore, \\(D_3\\) = Total distance - \\(D_1\\) - \\(D_2\\) - \\(D_4\\).\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\(D_3\\) = 23 meters - 5 meters - 8 meters - 0 meters\n\nSimplifying,\n\n\\(D_3\\) = 10 meters\n\nTherefore, the car had to travel 10 meters after the 3rd turn.\n####\n10"}
{"question": "To make pizza, together with other ingredients, Kimber needs 10 cups of water, 16 cups of flour, and 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour. Calculate the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that she needs to make the pizza.", "answer": "Let \\( W \\) represent the number of cups of water, \\( F \\) represent the number of cups of flour, and \\( S \\) represent the number of teaspoons of salt. The combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is given by:\n\n\\[ W + F + S \\]\n\nSince Kimber needs 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour, we can express \\( S \\) as \\( \frac{1}{2} F \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ W + F + \frac{1}{2} F \\]\n\nThis equation states that the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs is the sum of the number of cups of water (\\( W \\)), cups of flour (\\( F \\)), and half the number of cups of flour (\\( \frac{1}{2} F \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( W = 10 \\) cups (cups of water)\n- \\( F = 16 \\) cups (cups of flour)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ W + F + \frac{1}{2} F \\]\n\\[ 10 + 16 + \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \\]\n\\[ 10 + 16 + 8 \\]\n\\[ 34 \\]\n\nTherefore, Kimber needs a combined total of 34 cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt to make the pizza.\n####\n34"}
