{"question": "Hannah harvests 5 strawberries daily for the next whole month of April, which has 30 days. If she gives away 20 strawberries to her friends and 30 strawberries are stolen, how many strawberries does she have by the end of April?", "answer": "Let \\( S_H \\) represent the total number of strawberries Hannah has by the end of April, \\( S_D \\) represent the number of strawberries Hannah harvests daily, \\( S_G \\) represent the number of strawberries given away, and \\( S_S \\) represent the number of strawberries stolen. The equation to find the number of strawberries \\( S_H \\) Hannah has by the end of April is given by:\n\n\\[ S_H = S_D \\times 30 - S_G - S_S \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of strawberries Hannah has by the end of April (\\( S_H \\)) is equal to the number of strawberries harvested daily (\\( S_D \\)) multiplied by 30 days, minus the number of strawberries given away (\\( S_G \\)), and minus the number of strawberries stolen (\\( S_S \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S_D = 5 \\) strawberries daily (number of strawberries harvested daily)\n- \\( S_G = 20 \\) strawberries (number of strawberries given away)\n- \\( S_S = 30 \\) strawberries (number of strawberries stolen)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ S_H = 5 \\times 30 - 20 - 30 \\]\n\\[ S_H = 150 - 20 - 30 \\]\n\\[ S_H = 100 \\]\n\nTherefore, Hannah has 100 strawberries by the end of April.\n####\n100"}
