{"question": "Johannes owns a vegetable shop, he sells cabbage for $2 per kilogram. If Johannes was able to earn $30 last Wednesday, $24 last Friday, and $42 today, how many kilograms of cabbage was he able to sell?", "answer": "Let \\( C_W \\) represent the number of kilograms of cabbage sold last Wednesday, \\( C_F \\) represent the number of kilograms of cabbage sold last Friday, and \\( C_T \\) represent the number of kilograms of cabbage sold today. The total number of kilograms of cabbage sold by Johannes is given by:\n\n\\[ C_S = C_W + C_F + C_T \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C_S = $30 / $2 = 15 \\) kilograms (cabbage sold last Wednesday)\n- \\( C_S = $24 / $2 = 12 \\) kilograms (cabbage sold last Friday)\n- \\( C_S = $42 / $2 = 21 \\) kilograms (cabbage sold today)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_S = 15 + 12 + 21 \\]\n\\[ C_S = 48 \\]\n\nTherefore, Johannes was able to sell 48 kilograms of cabbage. \n####\n48"}
{"question": "Maria's birthday is in 22 days. Her friend Lilly wants to buy her flowers so she saves $2 each day until Maria's birthday. If a flower costs $4, how many flowers can she buy?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) be the number of days until Maria's birthday, \\( S \\) be the amount of money saved each day, and \\( F \\) be the cost of a single flower. The equation to find the number of flowers \\( N \\) Lilly can buy is given by:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{D \\times S}{F} \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of flowers (\\( N \\)) Lilly can buy is equal to the total amount of money saved (\\( D \\times S \\)) divided by the cost of a single flower (\\( F \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( D = 22 \\) days (number of days until Maria's birthday)\n- \\( S = \\$2 \\) per day (amount of money saved each day)\n- \\( F = \\$4 \\) per flower (cost of a single flower)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{22 \\times \\$2}{\\$4} \\]\n\\[ N = \\frac{\\$44}{\\$4} \\]\n\\[ N = 11 \\]\n\nTherefore, Lilly can buy 11 flowers. \n####\n11"}
{"question": "Millie, Monica, and Marius are taking subjects for school. Millie takes three more subjects than Marius, who takes 4 subjects more than Monica.
