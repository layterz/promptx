{"question": "A farmer has 46 chickens. Each chicken gives him 6 eggs a week. If he sells a dozen eggs for $3, how much money would he make in 8 weeks?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) represent the total number of chickens the farmer has, \\( E \\) represent the number of eggs each chicken gives per week, and \\( P \\) represent the price the farmer sells a dozen eggs for.\n\nThe equation to find the amount of money the farmer makes in a specific number of weeks \\( W \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ M = \\left( \\frac{{N \\times E}}{{12}} \\right) \\times P \\times W \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount of money the farmer makes (\\( M \\)) is the product of the number of eggs per week (\\( N \\times E \\)) divided by 12 to calculate the number of dozens of eggs, multiplied by the price per dozen (\\( P \\)), and then multiplied by the number of weeks (\\( W \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( N = 46 \\) chickens (total number of chickens)\n- \\( E = 6 \\) eggs per chicken per week (number of eggs each chicken gives per week)\n- \\( P = \\$3 \\) per dozen eggs (price the farmer sells a dozen eggs for)\n- \\( W = 8 \\) weeks (number of weeks)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ M = \\left( \\frac{{46 \\times 6}}{{12}} \\right) \\times \\$3 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ M = \\left( \\frac{{276}}{{12}} \\right) \\times \\$3 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ M = 23 \\times \\$3 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ M = \\$69 \\times 8 \\]\n\\[ M = \\$552 \\]\n\nTherefore, the farmer would make $552 in 8 weeks. \n#### 552"}
{"question": "Trevor is currently 11 years old and his older brother is 20 years old. How old will Trevor be when his older brother is three times as old as Trevor is now?", "answer": "Let \\( T \\) represent Trevor's age and \\( B \\) represent his older brother's age. We can start by finding the age difference between Trevor and his older brother, which is given by:\n\n\\[ D = B - T \\]\n\nWe are given that Trevor is currently 11 years old (\\( T = 11 \\)) and his older brother is 20 years old (\\( B = 20 \\)). Applying the values:\n\n\\[ D = 20 - 11 \\]\n\\[ D = 9 \\]\n\nThis means that Trevor's older brother is 9 years older than Trevor.\n\nNext, we need to find the age when Trevor's older brother is three times as old as Trevor is currently. Let \\( A \\) represent this age. We can set up an equation:\n\n\\[ B + A = 3T \\]\n\nGiven that Trevor is currently 11 years old (\\( T = 11 \\)), we can solve for \\( A \\):\n\n\\[ 20 + A = 3(11) \\]\n\\[ A = 33 - 20 \\]\n\\[ A = 13 \\]\n\nThis means that when Trevor is 11, his older brother will be 33 years old.\n\nTo find out how old Trevor will be when his older brother is three times as old as Trevor is now, we need to add the age difference \\( D \\) to the age \\( A \\):\n\n\\[ T = A + D \\]\n\\[ T = 13 + 9 \\]\n\\[ T = 22 \\]\n\nTherefore, when Trevor's older brother is three times as old as Trevor is now, Trevor will be 22 years old. \n\n#### \n22"}
