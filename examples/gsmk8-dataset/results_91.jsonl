{"question": "Brianna started out with a bag of 24 marbles.  She lost four marbles through a hole in the bag.  Then, she gave away twice as many marbles as she had lost through the hole in the bag.  Finally, her dog ate half as many marbles as Brianna had lost through the hole in the bag.  How many marbles did Brianna have remaining?", "answer": "Let \\( M \\) be the initial number of marbles Brianna had, \\( L \\) be the number of marbles lost through the hole in the bag, \\( G \\) be the number of marbles given away, and \\( D \\) be the number of marbles eaten by her dog. The equation to find the number of marbles \\( R \\) remaining is given by:\n\n\\[ R = M - L - G - D \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of marbles remaining (\\( R \\)) is the difference between the initial number of marbles (\\( M \\)) and the marbles lost (\\( L \\)), given away (\\( G \\)), and eaten by the dog (\\( D \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( M = 24 \\) marbles (initial number of marbles)\n- \\( L = 4 \\) marbles (marbles lost through the hole in the bag)\n- \\( G = 2 \\times L = 8 \\) marbles (marbles given away, which is twice the marbles lost)\n- \\( D = \frac{1}{2} L = 2 \\) marbles (marbles eaten by the dog, which is half the marbles lost)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ R = 24 - 4 - 8 - 2 \\]\n\\[ R = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Brianna has 10 marbles remaining."}
{"question": "Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?", "answer": "Let's denote the total number of hours in a day as \\(D\\), the number of hours spent cleaning as \\(C\\), the number of hours spent cooking as \\(K\\), the number of hours spent sleeping as \\(S\\), the number of hours spent crafting and tailoring as \\(CT\\), and the number of hours spent crafting as \\(C\\).\n\nThe equation to find the number of hours spent crafting is given by:\n\n\\[CT = D - C - K - S\\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of hours spent crafting and tailoring is the total number of hours in a day (\\(D\\)) minus the hours spent cleaning (\\(C\\)), cooking (\\(K\\)), and sleeping (\\(S\\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\(D = 24\\) hours (total number of hours in a day)\n- \\(C = 4\\) hours (hours spent cleaning)\n- \\(K = 2\\) hours (hours spent cooking)\n- \\(S = 8\\) hours (hours spent sleeping)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[CT = 24 - 4 - 2 - 8\\]\n\\[CT = 10\\]\n\nTherefore, Claire spent a total of 10 hours crafting and tailoring. Since she split her time equally between crafting and tailoring, she must have spent half of that time crafting.\n\n\\[C = CT \\times 0.5\\]\n\\[C = 10 \\times 0.5\\]\n\\[C = 5\\]\n\nTherefore, Claire spent 5 hours crafting. \n####\n5"}
{"question": "Martha has 18 crayons. She lost half of them, so she bought a new set of 20 crayons. How many crayons in total does Martha have after the purchase?", "answer": "Let \\( C_L \\) represent the number of crayons Martha lost, and \\( C_B \\) represent the number of crayons she bought. The total number of crayons \\( C_T \\) that Martha has after the purchase is given by:\n\n\\[ C_T = C_L + C_B \\]\n\nSince Martha lost half of her crayons, we can express \\( C_L \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2} C \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ C_T = \\frac{1}{2} C + C_B \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of crayons that Martha has after the purchase (\\( C_T \\)) is half of the original number of crayons she had (\\( C \\)) plus the number of crayons she bought (\\( C_B \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C = 18 \\) crayons (original number of crayons Martha had)\n- \\( C_B = 20 \\) crayons (number of crayons Martha bought)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_T = \\frac{1}{2} \times 18 + 20 \\]\n\\[ C_T = 9 + 20 \\]\n\\[ C_T = 29 \\]\n\nTherefore, Martha has a total of 29 crayons after the purchase.\n####\n29"}
