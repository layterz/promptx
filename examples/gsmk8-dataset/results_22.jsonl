{"question": "Ray has 95 cents in nickels. If Ray gives 25 cents to Peter, and twice as many cents to Randi as he gave to Peter, how many nickels does Ray have left?", "answer": "Let \\( N \\) represent the number of nickels Ray has left. \n\nGiven:\n- Ray has 95 cents in nickels\n\nTo find the number of nickels Ray has left, we need to subtract the amount of money given to Peter (\\( P \\)) and Randi (\\( R \\)) from the total amount of money Ray has in nickels. The equation to find the number of nickels \\( N \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{{\\text{{Total amount of money in nickels}} - P - R}}{{\\text{{Value of a nickel in cents}}}} \\]\n\nSince Ray gave twice as many cents to Randi as he gave to Peter, we can express \\( R \\) as \\( 2P \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{{\\text{{Total amount of money in nickels}} - P - 2P}}{{\\text{{Value of a nickel in cents}}}} \\]\n\\[ N = \\frac{{\\text{{Total amount of money in nickels}} - 3P}}{{\\text{{Value of a nickel in cents}}}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Ray gave 25 cents to Peter\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n\n\\[ N = \\frac{{95 - 25 - 3 \\times 25}}{{5}} \\]\n\\[ N = \\frac{{95 - 25 - 75}}{{5}} \\]\n\\[ N = \\frac{{-5}}{{5}} \\]\n\\[ N = -1 \\]\n\nSince \\( N \\) represents the number of nickels, a negative value is not possible. Therefore, there must be an error in the given information or calculation.\n\n#### -1"}
{"question": "Mac loves the shape of quarters and is willing to trade money for them, even if he loses value. He tells his brother that he will trade him 3 dimes for a quarter or 7 nickels.

How many dollars did Mac lose?", "answer": "Let \\( D \\) represent the number of dimes and \\( N \\) represent the number of nickels.\nThe equation to find the number of dollars \\( L \\) that Mac lost is given by:\n\n\\[ L = (0.05 \\cdot D) + (0.1 \\cdot N) \\]\n\nThis equation states that the number of dollars Mac lost (\\( L \\)) is the sum of the amount lost from trading with dimes (\\( 0.05 \\cdot D \\)) and the amount lost from trading with nickels (\\( 0.1 \\cdot N \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- Three dimes is equal to $0.3 because 3 \\times 0.1 = 0.3\n- Seven nickels is equal to $0.35 because 7 \\times 0.05 = 0.35\n- Each time he trades with dimes he loses $0.05 because 0.3 - 0.25 = 0.05\n- Each time he traded with nickels he lost $0.1 because 0.35 - 0.25 = 0.1\n- He lost $1 from trading with dimes because 20 \\times 0.05 = 1\n- He lost $2 from trading with nickels because 20 \\times 0.1 = 2\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ L = (0.05 \\cdot 20) + (0.1 \\cdot 20) \\]\n\\[ L = 1 + 2 \\]\n\\[ L = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, Mac lost a total of $3 in trading with dimes and nickels. \n#### 3"}

The number of gallons \\( G \\) that Martha's car requires for a 300-mile trip can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ G = \\frac{300}{M} \\]\n\nSince Martha's car gets half as many miles per gallon as Darlene's car, we can express \\( M \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2} D \\).
