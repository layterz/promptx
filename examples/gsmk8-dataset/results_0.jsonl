{"question": "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?", "answer": "Let \\( C_A \\) represent the number of clips sold in April, and \\( C_M \\) represent the number of clips sold in May. The total number of clips \\( C_T \\) sold in April and May is given by:\n\n\\[ C_T = C_A + C_M \\]\n\nSince \\( C_M \\) is half the number of clips sold in April, we can express \\( C_M \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2} C_A \\). Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ C_T = C_A + \\frac{1}{2} C_A \\]\n\\[ C_T = \\frac{3}{2} C_A \\]\n\nThis equation states that the total number of clips sold in April and May (\\( C_T \\)) is one and a half times the number of clips sold in April (\\( C_A \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C_A = 48 \\) clips (clips sold in April)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ C_T = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 48 \\]\n\\[ C_T = 1.5 \\times 48 \\]\n\\[ C_T = 72 \\]\n\nTherefore, Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May combined.\n####\n72"}
{"question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?", "answer": "Let \\( r \\) represent the rate Weng earns per minute and \\( t \\) represent the number of minutes Weng worked. The equation to find the amount Weng earned (\\( E \\)) is given by:\n\n\\[ E = r \\cdot t \\]\n\nThis equation states that the amount Weng earned (\\( E \\)) is equal to the rate of earnings per minute (\\( r \\)) multiplied by the number of minutes worked (\\( t \\)).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( r = \\frac{12}{60} \\) dollars per minute (rate of earnings per minute)\n- \\( t = 50 \\) minutes (number of minutes worked)\n\nApplying the values to the equation:\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{12}{60} \\cdot 50 \\]\n\\[ E = 0.2 \\cdot 50 \\]\n\\[ E = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Weng earned $10. \n#### 10"}
{"question": "Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs.
